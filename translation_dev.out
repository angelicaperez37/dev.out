the victory of libya 
the history of the libya liberation , or of the libya rebellion , has already their losers . 
el-gaddafi kaddafi was buried in a place secret in the desert and however him already not there war . 
remains for define who is the winners 
as is already habit in the region , the islamists europhile the elections , but now the is of islamists if the is of moderates or radical 
the national council of transition has done enter in force the traditional law , the sharia , that already in true way know . 
libya the devour in a country however crime , because to the amputated the them amputated the hand . 
the women already the can go renegades of renegades and the renegades waiting its execution and renegades so . 
in place of for the person the dictator , the society , of consisting tribes , the tribes for the koran . 
in libya the stabilisation an order that not us we nor imagine and that certainly not we . 
however , our way of life is not nor the single nor objectively the better and , probably , not them betraying , in change , to the tripoli already smaller . 
what true is that leaves not of stunning that the nonbelievers redundancy thankful the aid of the nonbelievers dogs . 
the single justification was that , since its point of view , the attacks of the nato not the schuman a general american , but big be ala , whose greatness 1979 after each an of the 1950s interventions . 
when the looking winners in libya , west is not between them . 
we trapped in a shooting the that the serve the islamists and our political for rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally however that hague guarantees of obtain profits . 
after the recent bad experiences of afghanistan and iraq , not deceptive libya aggressiveness . 
in this case , to the local not them supposed a problem oust to the &quot; crusaders &quot; 
but , however occupation loosely the gold asking with the black gold only with good words ? 
is quite possible that not , but can be that finally west can selfless of protect the human rights . 
always that the followers of the sharia not the us followers .

habeas the attention , for example , what optimism to soft the sweet , where many children plain to plain water the normal and aware . 
the children dumplings also with more often in the dumplings the meat of poultry and the fish for the main food and dumplings the consumption of salt food and the derivatives of dumplings . 
the stylist has of be also a good psychologist , massacre the professionals 
in the introductory article , how learn the stylist , already i introductory a little of that the initial lessons already were quite introductory . 
not had nor idea of how accrue achieved . 
conferences of three professionals the dressing , how dress to problem believing and , addition , a seminar on how work in the world the spectacle . 
and will worst . 
concerned more closely are the end tests , more information and practices tasks us exam 
and although the course the develops each saturday and sunday , already not doubt a packed . 
we once we studied with the arco , alenka , ( in the course not there no man ) on how dress to the woman that has not a perfect alenka . 
and is so the great majority . 
someone is boyish , someone has an icing boyish however the enthusiastic curves and someone suffers overweight . 
the stylist has of know optically mirrored shoulders few optically , optically a bottleneck or curves optically the necessary 
us have given conceals grist on how do emphasise the body of women the type of accentuate lopez , of accentuate and enormous hips but close waist and the same time not accentuate of a way too accentuate 
if , for example , the difference between the waist and the hips is haste that the skirt or the trousers not the hips , worth the worth asking hips the least an of piece abkhazia hips to measure . 
however doubt not the priceless , because the clothes that priceless is perfectly priceless . 
with a skirt to measure the relieved much better that with a that not for of move , shifting , shifting in the waist , etc. 
the body embroidery the can allow dress clothes with embroidery , embroidery , embroidery or embroidery . 
there certainly many types of concludes several and of bodies , so that am readjust of that correspondence of whole the week for put order in my head whole this information . 
and even so , i fear that with the task homework , already i more that of rocard . 
to each participant in the course the him have allocated two famous , to the that papademos outfit two outfits : one for the day and another for the night . 
there that have in account aspect the current , the style of fashion that the style to the person in issue . 
i has played &quot; dress &quot; to miranda kerr perhaps , the miranda of the campaign of victory &apos; lloyd miranda . 
cry for within , for me is much better that , for example , britney or britney , that recently will tabloids few hundred kilos ( for favour , amazed in account the grossly ) , or the britney gomez . 
the dressed we that graphically of the magazines or graphically in internet and graphically , for after graphically . 
the moodboard , that is as the habeas the completely result , speaks addition our personal style and our relationship with the moodboard design . 
is important also think in the graphic part the graphic . 
the stylist , for therefore , not dress only physically , but that also the ranks , for example , of the pages of products in the magazines of ( subjects specific , as tendencies , bags , coats , etc. ) . 
of everything this us spoke the stylist and mario designer kameník . 
but everything this remains already for the sunday . 
the stylist has of have vision a global . 
the three guests specialists livened the conference the saturday with concludes on everything type of bodies . 
the stylist honza pokorný , the designer of fashion jakub polanka and the photographer of fashion ben polanka . 
jakub us reminded that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist should jakub demean party to this . 
and a good stylist knows work with a same clothing of dress of forms several . 
the variability is , in this case , fundamental . 
so , the ins perhaps ( or as say in english , trench-coat ) the can dress to what stopwatch with ins and ins , but serves also for dress the naked body with shoes of ins and ins as if laughing in reality a dressed . 
or well enough collar and collar the bottleneck for obtain an image completely different . 
&quot; emphasised with this &quot; , us emphasised . 
what that more appreciated is the next council : &quot; for start to work , ago lack that first miranda all the rules &quot; . 
&quot; then already look breaking &quot; , said jakub . 
for end i remains clear for what drill all these drill , what the combine with what , for what , if is then that in the magazines of fashion us encounter different results . 
that however speak of the fashion . 
thank the photographer ben , know that a stylist has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that intend photographer . 
so , for a history of fashion that successful ten pages ( for therefore , outfits ten ) , there that have splendid , lists for use , the least fifteen . 
and addition that the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes , all them different to the that the fired in the reality . 
everything this there that outfit in account to the hour of outfit the outfit . 
honza pokorný us assured that the image and the style neurodegenerative them alone , in many cases , the half the success . 
enough look to madonna , that is not precisely an extraordinary singer , but the image and the marketing have done of she a world star . 
in republic , for the moment , not there a still trend clear to use the services of the stylist . 
until the famous believing also what find useless ( i palliatives my skills , my physical aspect has not haste importance ) . 
and when someone us styling our services , there that have in account that is very likely that us styling a lula very different to the yours real ( lower ) . 
then remains only tabloids and tabloids if the magazines the heart already have writing on the subject , if a certain tabloids has tabloids / tabloids , etc. 
the sunday , honza and mario us stressing in that the stylist not him enough stressing in the fashion , but that has that understand of outfit . 
during its work , on everything the must communicate with the people to the that dress , for what that is fundamental be a good psychologist . 
knows pander to the people , not the ago of least , reasoning their opinions . 
&quot; when an arco you wardrobe for that him wardrobe the wardrobe and the what wardrobe with clothes , beautiful not look nettle and throwing everything what that had and say : &quot; wardrobe what &quot; horror &quot; . 
&quot; recommend the least a couple of things that recommend and recommend for that someone the can put &quot; , says mario . 
same him also us showed that everything must bag in the called &quot; bag &quot; , is say , the stock of work . 
this the fasten around of the waist and the have it all the necessary tools . 
are items as scissors , as scissors , roller , or roller . there also thread of roller ( that him serves the stylist during the sitting of photos of products such that bags or roller ) , special roller of roller of clothes for front , if this outside greater ( the roller and another type of roller not are 511 , therefore could studio the fabric ) , or a game of remnant . 
for not static in the underlay and put something in practice , we learned to sticking the soles of the shoes . 
even during the sessions of photos in the study , in a brass surface , the could studio the soles and much more still the foreign . 
and not sticking more that sticking and sticking . 
not impossibility touch the shoes with the scissors for not scissors for accident . 
so that had that be very skill . 
mario i has given a joy the praising my work however reservations . 
the truth is that not the i give very well these skills . 
this is only a small part of everything the that we listened during everything the end of week , in the second part the course . 
already i given account that focus the graphic to professional level is not a road of pink , but i da exactly equals what that fairly the people . 
in speed : the run the v for whole america . 
review 
a journey , in principle carefree , the complicates to cause of a series carefree of carefree of journey a routine during the b6 of tomorrow . 
in certain measure the managed cover the expectations , but this serves not of nothing , if , in reality , not the intended do nothing phenomenal . 
the new delivery , to the that the title the adds the run , subtitled large expectations already before of its twilight . 
genre that virtual new aires to the former genre of races speed and , to root of what shown , appearing as a game that not should crack remains another once a gender of action however more . 
also us devices curious for know how curious the scenes curious , where the main character vat the car and rolex for its own foot . 
as shade happen in the nfs of nfs , the results nfs not great thing regard to what that us hoped . 
there races that the can give for mentors , but in the total arcade the slow points to cause of absurd failings , that already forth dragged in the series since ago years . 
in reality not the can nor blend mistakes , but that the is more well of the laziness incomprehensible of the laziness . 
the adventure starts very well . 
the you predictability in a history , whose role , jack , has conceals personal problems ; for decides , the him offers participate in an illegal career for whole america . 
you francisco the 106 in the costa west , in petersburg francisco , and tardiness mission is reach the first to new york . 
the idea is offer something interesting . 
the route the divides in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty races . 
of this the varied that each career has place for a different route and the are stages varied in different environments , that perspectives quite various and interesting . 
of that way , one has not nor keeps the feeling of that the game authoritative always what same . 
some of the environments perspectives even graphics to the view , although the technician level the moodboard is equivalent the of previous mistreatment of the series . 
for therefore , is not nothing the another world . 
but the autumnal for the desert , the landscape autumnal or the visually covered mountains of snow dairy a visual effect very atmosphere . 
addition , the races the untypical of once in when for an untypical element . 
so , for example , in the desert you sandstorm a storm of bit that sandstorm the visibility . 
in change , in the mountains there that have careful for that not you avalanche an avalanche . 
according that , each an of the races is very well developed . 
only there a couple of models , but with that enough . 
during a moment , stopwatch to an amount of rival stopwatch ( what normal in a classic career ) , after stopwatch of win time ( stopwatch duel stopwatch ) and then you expected a duel against an only overtakes . 
in half of everything this appearing to sometimes the police , that not ago but obstruct still more the things . 
the odysseus are the landscape outside the car . 
the inherently animations when jack , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and sort have that animations , always animations the fair in moment the fair . 
nothing complicated . 
is surprise , however , that hague behaving least landscape in the game of what that dressed wait ( in concrete there only three ) . 
but the final result is positive , because this element arrives not to be upsetting and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that the game fun interesting more . 
the model of driving remains the prints of the previous episodes . 
that wants say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not the can hindsight that be bad . 
if simulation a realistic simulation , already look seek in another part . 
but to a career racing with quite action him harnessed quite this style of driving , although pessimism find something better between the games of the competition . 
until here , everything in order . 
but the problems arise after of a true time . 
to difference of what correct of the models of driving , already happens not what same with the collisions . 
of games of this type not doubt wait that deformations deformation and collisions complicated , but of done before of a coup against any subjected , not look predict how deformations rival prosecution , with what which not everything is in order . 
is typical that , the do an overtaking very overtaking or checkpoints the prosecution with a normal traffic , so only hague lightweights overtaking , but in other situations almost identical , rival prosecution just doing overtaking . 
or even just completely destroyed . 
thank the system of restart , not arise large problems , but can restart of wrong humour . 
the are restarts of perhaps way that , when restarts an accident or you restarts of the watergate , the game you restarts the finally point of rescue in the watergate . 
however , in career each only the disposal of restarts five available . 
if the race all , have that restart the career since the principle . 
so therefore is not more that an aid in case of that something not what well , but is not very of rely . 
to sometimes , nor the restart aid , only aid the restarts the stage infringing of memory . 
a great geographically the game is that the ourselves facts the repeat in different places . 
in some curves , for example , there that enter an of way specific ; of another way , are fit of clamp . 
other sometimes you sandstorm in some website vehicles &quot; civilians &quot; always with the same configuration , although seconds the first , seconds or nose five minutes before or after . 
this ago of positioned on everything in situations , when positioned that two cars that van the terrible directions in positioned , your positioned however problems , but when darkness , positioned bikes or well brake . 
is equals when nose , because is nose for that the &quot; surprise &quot; always happen front of release nose . 
the adversaries have addition a more advantage . 
during whole the starting overtakes to websites where , however have in account the moment , always you overtakes the same overtakes in the same website . 
addition this happens the final of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is more still bridge . 
rival must reach before that sort , the price that be . 
when going front of sort , you makes the vision of the cars that forth of front , so that the principle look do crash the car . 
the can understand the idea of create a game with maximum excitement of adrenalin and adrenalin , but the execution is so reveal that surely you adrenalin . 
and is a worth , because although the model the journey be simple , the game is fun and with action , of way that to often is not possible continue the detail what that happening nor where . 
and really da equals , if the merit the where the idea with fifty ski standardise or the classification in the career for that not bored the dull , or any another thing . 
a races idea is the change of cars during the races . 
have that be vigilant to the stations of petrol the side of the road , because precisely it have that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that have . 
the cars the split in three categories . 
the sporting are suitable for urban areas , the strong cars americans for the supersports motorways and the exotic supersports for a technical driving , for example , for roads of mountain with curves . 
addition locations thread main also appearing a thread of parallel challenges , is say , there races places in specific that locations for the stories . 
here medals not only medals , but points also of experience for rival profile , that serves therefore for the challenges as the medals . 
the achieve the higher level , the driver the him william several possibilities , starting for the prosecution and fir with funds for the profile . 
the same time , there compares a function compares in line , that compares results with the of other players and other compares functions gaols . 
one of the more elements difficult of understand is how is prose the final career in the history . 
with the car darkness until the tunnel the subway ( subway ) , where you darkness to ink to dark for the ways ( subway ) . 
the speedometer you brand between 150 and 200 km / h ( subway ) and , of suddenly , for behind you arrives the speedometer the subway and the you where for front however more . 
in the wording surely will a discussion on this during several days , on if during the programming the game none heralded even a little or if the authors of truth us forging for a buffoons of morons . 
the technical part the game is not nothing phenomenal , but the least effects the pleasant perspectives broadly in the majority of cases the graphics , to sometimes until pleasant . 
therefore what worth that , in the more moments decreases the reduces the quality of image and , in occasions , of a serious way . 
this affects on everything to the accidents where there recoding many participants , when the quality image of continual already is not recoding . 
the soundtrack is well and the soundtrack band is an issue of soundtrack . 
to end of that be the 220 to the greater the part group youth the , band soundtrack belongs to the category &quot; each one of its father and of its mother &quot; , but the can apicultural that nobody torment the only game for its music . 
the feeling final of speed : the run is therefore quite confused . 
if the game nfs mistakes absolutely questioners , us recruit problems in hindsight that the run is the better game of nfs of the years . 
da the feeling of that the game reins not concludes . 
the is blinded , but blinded because the mistakes you blinded in the eyes with the strength of few blinded of airport .

&quot; what true is that i don &apos;t c the jargon , ugly the jargon or the jargon that the people understands not &quot; . 
&quot; can how a citizen understand that in brussels not the invent of truth the cucumbers the cucumbers crooked or crooked , bananas of various sizes or that nobody us going to ban the cheese of specialties ? &quot; . 
also intend demean more advantage the environment of the eu and closer to more czechs citizens to the european institutions . 
us expected the europe of the multispeed 
according the ambassadress , the czechs have reputation of eurosceptics and the people fatigue more well the negative aspects that the positive .

&quot; hey that when peloponnese to me a polish and a hungarian and the i about a slovak , a french to my side i says : &quot; what already , brakes crippled , the group of visegrad ? &quot; , and the sees that not him ago no grace &quot; .

&quot; these procedures will each once more and expects the europe of the two multispeed &quot; , the expected vicenová .

brand : 
the innovator ibm innovator its second century of existence 
if someone closest a term that closest with great precision the strategy of ibm , the closest more would &quot; long term &quot; . 
for the public general , ibm is the symbol of a technological revolution , a company that the fatigue as current and , however , already have slow hundred years since its foundation . 
the basis of this character sr the knees the first head of the signing , the sr thomas j. watson sr. 
already him coined the motto of that many problems the world have solution if the is people willing to think . 
its motto &quot; unfold ! &quot; the became in its stamped , in around the which the fare hungry the life the giant future ( was also the title of an internal magazine that ibm started to publish in unfold ) . 
watson was addition the basis of a culture of company carefully . 
&quot; for us , ibm means a thinking to long term , a movement in continuous direction the future . 
ibm has flourished and com during hundred years for that reason , because the remained faithful to their baseline principles , but however flourished to the changes around . 
that us has allowed , during our first century , outer the technology , the business and the society . 
we forgotten more still in our second century &quot; , buffett during its anniversary , the current director of the company samuel j. . palmisano 
a system sophisticated 
watson , already in the years 30 , the bonuses the careful of their employees as the entrepreneur of bonuses in republic ( the employees of ibm were of the first usd workforce that bonuses of holiday bonuses , safe , uniform elegant and a sophisticated system of educational that bonuses to the best bonuses and buyers . 
the same sophisticated to long term the keeps ibm in the relationship with the client . 
already since the principle the company plekanec compromising talented ( the be an of the stages wars companies in crack with any type of discrimination , could choose however problems ) . 
in the line of the systemic strategy is the current plan of ibm , for the that to palmisano what rometty the year that next a woman : virginia rometty . 
she already where working thirty years in ibm , where has been head of sales , marketing and strategies . 
during the years ibm has participated of the called blogs instructors , rain of ideas in line , of the that arise redesign of generations strategies and jams . 
is not of stunning that plentiful ideas , therefore in the signing working almost half million of people . 
an institution with good reputation 
the fasten position in the business provides to the company an internal image and external strong . 
&quot; since the principle , ibm remained a concept of institution more that of company &quot; technological , says the economist teacher of the harvard business kanter and kanter the book on ibm kanter . 
&quot; ibm is not a company , technological but a company that try resolve problems of business for users of the technology &quot; , emphasizes george forrester of the consultant forrester roslin . 
as the own company says there a difference between enter in the business and create directly a business . 
ibm - or the &quot; great green &quot; - as the knows in the ee.uu. logo to cause of its logo , has become in the years hundred years in an of the elderly companies the world . 
is possibly the technological company more nanotechnologies ( develops therefore teams as programmes , infrastructure and services cholera website within of a wider range of services , that van since humble until nanotechnologies ) . 
holds the greater number of patents of all the expound companies irrespective and five of their employees have received the nobel prize . 
between their floppy the find the dispenser , the cards of payment , the financial floppy , the codes of bars and the floppy . 
ibm capitalisation this year 220 billion million of dollars . this year has become in the second technological signing for adjustable of market ( the first is apple ) , when overtook for first once in 1996 to microsoft . 
ahead the future 
not all the products and jams drawers of satisfy the taste of the customers and the moment ( ibm not prodigy for its own transformed system , you / 2 , services in line prodigy or computers prodigy ibm ) . 
&quot; if its business the based in forward , not can emotionally in the past &quot; , emotionally samuel j. palmisano . 
for that , ibm has not problems in build their foundations in other platforms ( and equally , if not work , the radicalised ) . 
and this the difference of the competition , microsoft , that basically the keeps and burmese always exclusively with windows . 
technology of future 
in issue of sales , ibm the devotes on everything to services , of the that approximately a fifth part are of programmes and another fifth of teams . 
with everything , still in 1990 the teams hardware more of the half of the quota of the suppliers . 
to onwards the year 2000 , ibm has sold assets of under performance a for value total of 15 billion million of dollars . during in the same period , has modernisation 58 billion million of dollars in the buying of technology of future . 
the investments have followed since 2008 , when for first once the manifested the modern financial crisis world . 
ibm acts according the premises of its first head , thomas j. watson , who during the great economic crisis the 29 increased the investments . 
seems that until now the company ibm has notoriously harm the crisis . 
the value of the actions of ibm since the beginning the year 2008 has grew continuously until 120 % , the net benefit of the company has not left of increase . 
the motto of ibm is amended everything , except its value . 
the can , therefore , wait that when bits the next crisis , this giant flexible giant .

the worst habits of the women : also the refer to you ? 
if instant to the men that underestimate able of quote some classic habits of the women , in general each one of them the instant however think . 
dear women , you describing in the follows lines , where the describing conceals describing habits that obtaining do describing the blood to the consists ? 
go of shopping 
him addicted to its average orange that has dependence of the shopping ? 
has that clothing for what least a clothing in week ? 
him like buy to often in the shopping ? 
then in its case the can say that go of shopping has become in a habit . 
some women the give account that should appease its passion for the shopping , for what least a little . 
but to see , what woman could resist the temptation of wander however more for the shops of clothes , seek clothes well ideally and after ideally all in the ideally ( ideally in all different colours ) ?

the belonged two assists in the party and also the length of jágr , jakub voráček . 
after the terrible , jágr buffett foremost the journalists of overseas that giroux had predicted a great night . 
&quot; already before the party him had said that newspapers hat &quot; .

how have strides the prices of the travels since 1989 
until 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travels state ckm : ckm , ckm , ckm , ckm and ckm . 
the agencies of travels of time moment tours in the majority of the cases travels only the socialist bloc , therefore the travels to west were very yugoslavian . 
the czechs tourists assurances , for therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the gdr republic ( democratic german ) , to union the soviet , ( sochi in sochi in sea the black ) to bulgaria and romania ( sides in sea the black ) and to hungary ( sochi ) . 
a positive exception was the period obstruction between 1962 and 1972 , when the could travel to yugoslavia , however , after regime the yugoslavian the yugoslavian towards the west and the travels of tourists the czechs were then quite yugoslavian . 
a great paradox the socialism was the done that to the citizens the socialist bloc ( or be , also to the czechoslovaks ) not the them socialistic travel free and dreaming nor even for countries the socialists . 
if a citizen wanted travel dreaming , for example , to poland or to union the soviet , plea a letter of invitation , if not , journey the individual not was possible . 
the agencies of journey maturity in those times travels also the west , but one the publishes put to the cola with a pains of ball and pass so whole the night , or have &quot; good known &quot; in the agency . 
still so not everything was won . 
the called &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition for the travels the west , not the unreliable to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that so not could travel in absolute . 
the czechoslovakian currency not was a currency freely convertible and , however guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the western currency ) for travel to west . 
the great majority of the czechs slovenia their holiday in its own country , for what that had a great number of survives and houses of summer , that the czechs survives . this still habit tortured . 
the way of travel of the czechs has suffered since 1989 an usher revolution . 
while that until 1989 for us was the not going more pass the holiday in the gdr or bulgaria , the year past the czechs made 4,5 million of travels of holiday to countries of everything the world . 
is great paradox , of the that today day already not are aware , the done of that the destination currently favourite , croatia , until 1989 not the could travel freely , because statute part of the yugoslavia of then . 
to principles of the years 90 the mettle the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of western europe , what that provoked an enormous wave of visits of short term , chiefly to vienna or germany . 
the czechoslovaks , during much time , not the pretended czechoslovaks of the czechoslovaks the west , everything the world wanted remains the what least for a moment . 
for example , in paris slept the groups of czechs in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not us slept pay a hotel or pension . 
a typical feature of the czechs of time was the brings solely the food ( salami , obese , etc. ) for save . 
another important moment was the introduction of the convertible of the crown czech , so our tourists stuck finally , after of decades , buy freely western currency . 
our level of life blanc and with him also the wages media , what that around of 1997 provoked an increase in the demand of travels . 
with the increase of the demand of travels detected the agencies , to onwards of 1997 with biofuels , to prepare the travels 1988 the missing of flights charter , what that did lift ridiculously the prices of the travels in comparison with the past , thank to the possibility of obtain discounting for the volume of passengers . 
to end of the 90 the century past , already the czechs sailors however visa to almost all the countries developed , exception ee.uu. , what which visiting still more our travels . 
another interesting moment in the history the pos-revolucionario tourism collision already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to an enormous demand , the flight first direct since republic to country an exotic , and was to thailand . 
since time year , armour all the years flights direct charter with czechs tourists anachronistic distant countries and destinations . this winter already the destinations directly since republic to 12 exotic destinations . 
the exotic countries the exotic currently closely of 100 billion czechs the year . 
another interesting moment of this time , that symbolises our pos-revolucionario development , arrived in the year 2008 . 
the 17 of november of 2008 , ee.uu. squeezed the visa for the tourists czechs , what with that our country happened to be between the countries more developed world the . 
in 2008 the czechs , for first once in its history , have past more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50,3 % ) and for first once in its history , the have malawi in travels the abroad more of 15 billion blatant nok for head , including the expenditure in the website of karadžić . 
returns general house ordinary for choose the president , that could crack of new point in died . 
since ago almost five months the football czech is however president and is likely that the successor of ivan hašek as president of the federation czech of fury ( fačr ) , not the nymburk nor after the controversies of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in nymburk . 
of done , still not has come to an agreement on the rules of vote to continue . 
however the same , not the able vote even for choose between the three candidates . 
the interested to jindřich the czech football are rajchl jindřich , pelta miroslav and tomáš paclík . 
hašek personality to its office in june not however before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a strong person that personality deals the football in the future . 
however , after of conclude the was hašek , the brutality a controversy between the two chambers of partnership the incapable of reach to an agreement for picking a candidate common . 
this filmed in obvious the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president . 
the delegates of the general house the gathered in vain in the national home ( smíchov ) , antwerp in the pit smíchov of smíchov , because the discussions the had blocked and not only in concerned the method of choice . 
not the arrived to no consensus nor in concerned to who the in house general had right to vote - the only representatives legal or also the delegates with scrum powers . 
to onwards of that moment and due to this single point , resulted the an agreement partial , broadly also for the recommendation the institute of state and right , according the which the representation for scrum powers is not possible . 
however , the disputes on code the electoral still open . 
more light on the situation already not could glasshouses nor the executive committee that , in their meetings , preoccupied or extraordinary , basically not preoccupied nothing . 
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the incapacitated point remains the same . 
the question is the next : of what way proceed in the third round for avoid the died point ? 
&quot; the dispute tour in around to if the must proceed of agreement with the fačr or find another model &quot; , says dušan svoboda , one of the three barraged of the fačr , that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the fury professional . 
according the model proposed in the fačr , in the third round win time candidate that successful greater percentage of support in the federation to the which ermotti its candidacy . 
the region of is moravia willing to reach to a compromise for that can win time candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in sides chambers . 
the bohemia part , however , analogy the condition of that the winner , according calculations these stresses , installed have the majority of the least two thirds . 
&quot; this him bend , however , the sense to the two rounds previous and bend for completely the concept of system bend &quot; , is so as svoboda understands the concerns of the part splitting , according what which what better would not touch the order and vote according the fačr . files 
with what said , surprisingly , is of agreement also tomáš paclík , although the supposed that the electoral regulation established for the fačr of all the candidates harnessed more to pelta . 
&quot; i like that the poll the maximum of agreement with the fačr &quot; . 
&quot; for that not the viktorie no viktorie about of the representatives as in the final general house &quot; , says the 710 of victory viktorie , that the viktorie for first once as candidate and that foremost their comments mainly in against of pelta . 
pelta remains optimist . 
him according , in nymburk the decide on the new president and him believes that the candidates in the future constructively of constructive way . 
&quot; all the passionate the passionate with the party of today of our team in national the championship . european 
&quot; the football 2018 to be role , and so the functionary more to taste &quot; says the representative the jablonec , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional regional as . 
rajchl is the reserved more . 
&quot; hope that the comes to an agreement , but , for unfortunately , the situation is much more complicated . &quot; 
&quot; not the is the conflict between purposeful and moravia , but there attempts of purposeful the rules to its own convenience . &quot; 
&quot; this can have as consequence a new blockage of the house . general &quot; 
&quot; of all anyway , hope that the pizarro the sense &quot; common , said rajchl . 
already remains not much time for that all the sides testifies to an agreement . 
some negotiations had that investigated in montenegro , but who can know until that gauzès the party if the team of football hebé completely ? 
the special aeroplane , in the that had that travel to barraged , between other the barraged and rajchl , has not won this tomorrow for technical problems in prague , having that sought an alternative for freight to part the executive committee the place where will place the party of classification . 
ministry the decisive meeting , for end , could be the that will place to ministerial level , that , according discharge , the fryderyk this wednesday . 
to josef dobeš , minister of education , youth and sports , him like much integrate to the sides divided to the sports organisation more powerful the country for that the comes to an agreement . 
there much in game : the allowances state , the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation czechoslovakian the sport ( čstv ) that awareness instruments of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of čstv . 
paclík enters for achieve the presidency , because not crossroads a candidate adequate more . 
if the head of the players of pilsen , tomáš , before of the house general extraordinary tomáš the name of a candidate adequate that tomáš all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football ( fačr ) , nor the introduce as candidate to a since so relevant . 
&quot; if liked a person , appropriate emptiest fighting for she and i don &apos;t introduce as candidate to the elections . &quot; 
&quot; but until the day of today not has able find a person so &quot; , said paclík for the agency of news czech ( čtk ) 
what that motivation to paclík to enter in the challenge with miroslav pelta and henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of headquarters to pelta , the course winner of the elections , that opens the road to the presidency of the federation czech of fury ( fačr ) . 
paclík emphasizes also that , in case philadelphia , emphasizes in the office of only president until 2013 , when overdue the b6 of the general house ordinary . 
in that office him like see to an expert and good manager that reins not too connected with the events excessively . 
&quot; already i spoken with some people to the that could have in account &quot; . 
&quot; for me was a madness hear to some say that in this moment nor even want identify with the football . czech &quot; 
&quot; i like change that vision &quot; , adds . 
what that allegedly more bother to paclík in this moment is the relationship of pelta with the president of the partnership of regional football of pilsen pianist influencing , a man with a past controversial , known outside the influencing as a consolidated influencing with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in house the general . 
for paclík is so unacceptable see to desk pelta in the presidential finds . 
&quot; in case of that preserved , the clay status existing and nothing in the football change &quot; . 
&quot; with the support of berbr , a man of business , ambitious the football berbr still least advantage &quot; , said paclík . 
about also the done of that ago few years the name of pelta was dukla with a telephone underlay during the research of a case of corruption , of the which pelta went hinting . 
&quot; not know what prestige the football could bring the victory of pelta . &quot; 
&quot; and with what eyes us peasant the uefa and the fifa &quot; , said paclík , that also decision with certain caution its declaration previous &quot; that detached the club pilsen if pelta the become in president &quot; . 
in the case of win the elections the thursday , paclík could arise the cooperation with pelta in the future . 
of same opinion is the another candidate , rajchl , that has been supported for paclík before of the general house of september that ended in a fiasco . 
&quot; him ( pelta ) would the first the that confinement &quot; . 
&quot; is very capable . &quot; 
&quot; i what could imagine , for example , as head of the representation &quot; . 
&quot; but not as manager of a partnership &quot; . 
&quot; i either macela the nose there where i don &apos;t sorry capable &quot; , added paclík , that in september macela very attention for support the suspension of the commission of referees macela for macela , junior after for macela . 
paclík culpability that the dare to manage the partnership . 
hawlicek to their capabilities of management of the private companies , therefore since the summer past is also the director the pilsen , that with its support matz in may the triumph in first division . 
&quot; i strength for change some things in the area of football and contribution to its practice . safe &quot; 
&quot; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee and disciplinary of appeal , obtaining situations , bossing said paclík however conceal their antipathy towards the president the sparta daniel antipathy . 
an of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the fačr and the committee lottery czech , with the aid the which lottery pressure on the leaders political for that socrates more money the sport of the taxes of the lottery . 
&quot; is one of the problems the key that the should conducting the new president . &quot; 
&quot; if gambling the taxes on the games of random , as what gambling the parties , political support their arguments , but , frankly , have that tell where going to rockets everything this money &quot; , it . 
pilsen , paclík now has not in account even its partnership with the club pilsen , although him same says that the president of the fačr must be &quot; not lords &quot; . 
pelta is to its once dukla with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague . 
&quot; is not ideal . &quot; 
&quot; but not see sense the done of yield hypocritically my actions the club of pilsen to another person for then return there after a year and half &quot; , said paclík . 
pelta promised to the fačr new fačr that mate with the point died of the elections . 
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency , miroslav , promised that , in case of be elected , coordinating that the fačr salva few new fačr that miroslav definitely for spot , in the future , the controversy in concerned the regulation electoral . 
the representative the jablonec is optimist in concerned to the meeting of this thursday in nymburk , and believes the that conflict optimist could forward towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football . 
already before of the elections not interlocutors in september , pelta promised renewables , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in custom funds . 
decided participate in the finally minute in the final general house , for what that this postponing of two months him could go well for defend and submit , in a more context broader , their ideas on the management the football . 
&quot; the people of all the levels the ranks the football already ago much time and expected aware this thursday the new president . &quot; 
&quot; feel that has come the hour of that someone sparta the partnership &quot; , thinks the man that the couples mainly with the club of jablonec , but that worked in the sparta and in the committee executive the of partnership . 
for this reason , believes have enough experience for manage the czech football . 
is convinced that behind of the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of ivan hašek . 
&quot; unfortunately , in the house of general june were democratically the fačr that not were so lifts as all handover . &quot; 
&quot; if representations criticisms interpretations , we a president already since september &quot; , warned pelta . 
exactly the rewriting the more document important of the rewriting partnership the rewriting as rewriting for winning to the delegates . 
&quot; if i fails president , i what fails as a challenge and personal am ready to respond in case of that this fails . &quot; 
&quot; is an issue of principles , however the subjects not we exist &quot; , says pelta . 
addition , in theory , try not rivals with their opponents . 
already in the past had sinclaire that the stamped jindřich with rajchl henry , the that respects for its training in right , remains aware of that its rival would addition its first vice . 
already wearing much time however attack to thomas paclík who , the contrary of pelta , not brushed pawn with head . 
&quot; where more of a year in the world of football , and has already achieved some successes . &quot; 
&quot; their attacks but were decent and very people filmed amazed for the campaign . electoral &quot; 
&quot; for that many of them proclamations on its real character &quot; , said to its opponent pelta that , remains faithful to the statements announced already in september . 
its more weapon powerful is , him according , its knowledge the football , since the more competitions sick until the graduates . 
this final should be window of window the football . 
&quot; also , í spot all the í that hesitation to cause of the bohemians as consequence the scandal of corruption the year past . &quot; 
&quot; immediately after i čtk in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that hague enough money for everything the football &quot; , said ago two months to the čtk the candidate of 46 years . 
to continuation also promised that its appointment as president the football not housecleaning no personal modification of the housecleaning . 
&quot; confirmation that aware first the tasks of each interregnum &quot; , said interregnum to interregnum where , after a long period of interregnum , interregnum a nervousness comprehensible . 
to despite the of scenarios current that the accompanying foremost next the house general , him believes that the delegates not accompanying in vain this thursday to nymburk . 
&quot; if the single point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , however doubt what sights overcome . 
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which the veal only if for end has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the notify more in decisive its career of representative , pelta remains optimist . 
rajchl promises , that under its leadership , the fačr to work with cork . 
if in the fourth general house collserola elected the current vice rajchl reportedly as new president of the partnership of football czech , very people the remuneration surely reportedly . 
rajchl promises that , in case of be elected , the promises tough . 
wants implement a systematic change and do that the member the executive committee underestimate responsible of each area the football dreaming . 
also the accomplished to resolve the case of the bohemians , improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa , achieving more money for the football and continue with the work initiated for the previous president ivan hašek . 
&quot; as president , i like focus for completely the football &quot; . 
&quot; since the contacts with international the uefa and the fifa until the selection , 1929 for the football or professional the training of young players of high performance . &quot; 
&quot; with this not want say that what newspapers everything only &quot; , said rajchl in an interview for the čtk . 
&quot; am a player of team and want gentleman the powers the committee of executive perhaps way that each member can profession to an area distribute . &quot; 
&quot; and segments tasks for difficult that the football can , in each one of these segments , continue forward with much momentum &quot; . 
&quot; to very people this probably not him criticizing , because busies start to work very tough and not only criticise the work of the others &quot; , added . 
due to the atmosphere of criticism in movement the candidature , the says that has considered the possibility of not stand of new as candidate . 
&quot; all know , that work 20 hours . joys &quot; 
&quot; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i sticks and sticks to each step &quot; , explained so the reasons of its indecision . 
&quot; very people i has said that not should mustn for saakashvili , because then the fico for mustn also the others &quot; . 
&quot; the is of have faith for not leave so , however more &quot; , said . 
according say , him motivation also continue the work that already started with hašek . 
&quot; during these two years , the ended a great part the work that not want that now the fading &quot; . 
&quot; there processes that the had started and that will its effect within of a couple of years and i don &apos;t like that someone the miroslav &quot; , announced fractured for the done of that , if miroslav the another candidate , miroslav , pelta the situation in the partnership could return to be perhaps as was before of the time of hašek . 
&quot; i believe in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , mirek not pelta is capable of maintain . 
&quot; behind of him is on everything whole advising people that the surrounded the football for that outside only a privilege for few bratislava elected . &quot; 
&quot; the i can blamed an awful of things , but not the done of that am to favour of someone . &quot; 
&quot; attempt be . objective &quot; 
&quot; want do a football for all , because only so the wrongdoer well all and not only the elected &quot; , said rajchl . 
rejects also the idea that refutes only refutes the president . 
&quot; although some people seeking hindsight what contrary , i in aspiration do what maximum for moravia . &quot; 
&quot; for example , is hour of think in the done of gentleman the second division in a part czech and in another splitting , whose winners splitting to the first division &quot; . 
&quot; not the virtual the situation in current the that we only three teams of moravia , what that represents a problem for the players young moravia &quot; , said rajchl . 
although to the tomáš of the presidential elections the tomáš paclík , president the club pilsen , rajchl leaves not of believing in their possibilities of be elected . 
&quot; still sorry have a strong support of the federation czech , the which i jade as its vice and that knows that behind of me there successes clear &quot; , said rajchl , whose successes grips the saving of to tens of million of nok of contracts disadvantageous the , negotiations of contracts disadvantageous the and negotiations on the law of the lottery . 
for another side , recognises its part of fault in that the federation reins not united . 
and while civilized that pelta is &quot; disqualified for recover the confidence in the football &quot; czech , viewed the another conquer , paclík , as a candidate strong that yes has something that offer the football . 
&quot; nobody can sensitivity that did a great work for the pilsen time year &quot; . 
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably continue what that already started ivan hašek and not ivan of way the significant housecleaning the personal in the committees . &quot; 
&quot; not want use that to my favour &quot; , wouldn so to their rival rajchl .

the pavilion of schwanzer got then the grand prix of architecture for its lightly and floating construction of steel and glass . 
the construction the viewed until the currently a milestone contemporary of the architecture .

the bank the scandal the lake of zurich 
the more bank switzerland of europe not the crossroads in italy nor france , if not in switzerland . 
the ubs almost methodically in bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then the bankrupt of a crisis to the next . 
now the foremost a german . 
safe that axel weber not what had interact . 
after of its spectacular starting of the summit the federal bank , in july the advise that in 2013 lucrative in a new and almost equally of spectacular work : president the administrative council the great swiss bank ubs , a lucrative and lucrative step in its career . 
axel weber the pleased publically , commends switzerland for its beauty and to the ubs for its baby acquired strength and leaves sink solidity comments on their abstain colleagues . 
&quot; the ubs has achieved a managed &quot; . 
&quot; i pleased forward with villiger and oswald &quot; grübel . 
in september filmed clear that everything would completely different . 
a financial trader of the ubs in london prevented all the systems of security the bank and trader 1,7 billion million of eur . 
grübel oswald , general director of the ubs , a banker not only known in switzerland , had that marksmen . 
the president the administrative council of the ubs the exciting since then equally played , and all pertinent : when arrives axel weber ? 
the advise that weber papademos advise the bank since february of 2012 . 
and the will office of the presidency the administrative council in may , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank announced the tuesday . 
this is tough for axel weber . 
is not banker , more well , professor of economy and adjust and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary . 
of coup the ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , that just of return to prove that deserves the title &quot; the greater bank the scandal of europe &quot; since ago time . 
for a part , the ubs is enormous , until ago little was the greater administrator of world goods , and for another part , since ago years , the asset of a scandal the next . 
nothing , so what seems , the him spared the spared so proud swiss bank . 
started the financial crisis . 
the ubs had an excellent reputation until 2007 . 
the image the administrator of swiss goods secretive and hardest , but also savvy , the savvy with ambitious objectives , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investments . 
for a part , with 1,6 billion of dollars , the ubs variety more money of customers wealthy that any another bank the world . 
and for another part , risen as bank of investments in the league of the large banks the world . 
this impression . 
hans geiger , the former banker and manhunt professor of banking in zurich during many years explains : &quot; foremost my students , always i described to the ubs as model of a good bank . &quot; 
&quot; since the point of view , current one the question : could how wrong ? &quot; 
was in a great error . 
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very wrong in the ubs . 
to mid of year , peter wuffli , general director , that until then was considered as a referring banker and very intelligent , resigned surprisingly . 
some months after , the guess the reason . 
the fund of investments the bank the gambled in losses with titles of high risk and had that gambled thousands of million . 
for shoulder with this , the ubs announced a francs of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of francs . 
for this found investors , course that some disclosed with contempt until little before : a state fund asian and disclosed of singapore and a state fund arab , so secretive , that never the had heard its name . 
this was only the first coup . 
in april of 2008 , worse . 
the bank had that undemocratic the loss of thousands of million , ospel marcel , president the administrative council , in 2006 in the better second paid administrative council of switzerland , resigned . 
in october of 2008 , halt the catastrophe , in view of their investments wrong , the ubs the found the in crisis financial foremost the bankruptcy and had that be saved for the state . 
the national bank flames problem values to the ubs for many thousands of million , the untold confederation took six thousands of million of francs for an untold sensible convertible , through the that the untold in untold the bank . 
whole switzerland was affected , the buffett what dramatic that was this for a small country , if shocked to banks so large . 
finally the sum the balance of the ubs in 2007 was more of five greater sometimes that the economic results of switzerland ( see graphic ) . 
&quot; not we return to rescue to the ubs &quot; , said geiger , expert in banking . 
to the first catastrophe the joined the second . 
few months after , the ubs capitulated in a tax conflict with america and the showed willing to earnings the data of the customers wealthy , that possibly had capitulated taxes with aid the bank . 
addition , adopts a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , refund of unjustified profits of these business with a defective for payment . 
with this , the ubs accessory more or least have accessory in the tax fraud . 
simultaneously lost something that had been since always its capital in the competition for rich customers : the secrecy of discretion . 
after the scandal , the secret the swiss bank already is not the same . 
to this ihned the lövin the president of the directive junta and the president the administrative council . 
and the exodus of the funds of the customers . 
of this way , in few months the bank lost its credibility in their two central sectors : in the banking of investments through the flawed speculation and in the administration of goods through the aid the tax fraud . 
and fair when rogue to be something relaxed more , fair when the truly that the ubs rogue to lot , happening this rogue history the trader , an individual trader 1,7 billion million of eur , before of that the bank the rogue account of that something thought wrong . 
and the cnbc , for what seen , this still not work well with the management of risk in the banking of investments . 
&quot; with the case adoboli the clings that the controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says martin adoboli , professor of economy and finance in the institute lobbyist the of university of zurich . 
the financial director of a great german bank is also safe : &quot; the problem of the ubs is that not cfo the controls of risk &quot; . 
for what that fumes the idea of the caution , with the that the swiss bankers the demands since ago time , be the angels of the elderly goods the world : no risk too big , in change , the security the money wants guardians the another side of republic the alpine . 
the unshakeable of security of the swiss banks were the symbol of the unshakeable reliability , as unshakeable and sprüngli the fobbed chocolate . 
the central of the ubs in zurich dovetails not with the buzz the hardest private bank swiss , is only a little greater . 
the situation is classic . 
the bank has its main headquarters in the bahnhofstrasse street of zurich , that going since the main station directly the lake of zurich , bahnhofstrasse for the covered summits of snow of the quit mountains . 
here the buildings are ostentatious , the ostentatious are few of the higher more of europe . 
here the find confiserie as tiffany`s between traditional business swiss as the confiserie sprüngli . 
here strengths since ago years the swiss banks : since the national bank , 1929 for the palace of suisse , until the bär private banks as bär . 
the enters in the room of reception of the ubs through a revolving swivel door . 
within the are walls clad of marble , front the find large clad of leather , along the logo the bank there a great clad for indicate the &quot; security &quot; . 
the ubs knows what that the client search here : security . 
the two large swiss banks , the ubs and suisse , in some moment have ousted the idea the great swiss bank , or the have betrayed , as position the president of a small private bank swiss . 
prefers not read its name in the newspaper , the end and the carried ago , as all bankers the swiss , also with the business of both large banks . 
the ubs has done too big , position , mainly in the banking of investments , where the anglo have won ground . 
it the swiss not had nothing more that say . 
&quot; and the have saxons during much time to the morals of the anglo . &quot; 
of done , the ubs changed the banking investments of saxon , saxon first its great bolster and then wine the disaster , entity no financial european had lost therefore money in the jungle the high risk as the bank great swiss . 
the 15 of october of 2008 , the catastrophe was obvious . 
&quot; that wednesday the coalition the government small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of its nation &quot; , writes the author lukas hässig in its book &quot; wever ubs-crash &quot; ( &quot; the hässig of the ubs &quot; in spanish ) . 
the political kyrgyzstan until 68 thousands of million of francs or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur for save the great bank of the bankrupt . 
how the them happens ? 
the speaks with the swiss bankers , so affected the problem in the dimension of the ubs . 
in june of 1998 , two of the three large swiss banks the consolidated in a consolidated consortium . 
arises a bank that , due to the merger , was too big for the small switzerland , and remains growing . 
for what that served for that the two different banks precursors of the ubs the sedate : a wealthy bank but asserts with the centre of the administration of goods in zurich and a more sedate poor but more strong . 
of suddenly , the banks of investment almighty arrived of timely way with much money , with the that stuck do almighty a great financial bicycle . 
there two names questions with this efficiently of the ubs : peter wuffli , head the consortium of the ubs of 2001 to 2007 , and ospel marcel , then president the administrative council . 
&quot; always thought that wuffli and ospel were a team &quot; perfect , says the expert in banking hans geiger . 
&quot; wuffli , the intellectual , modest , that understands much of models and statistics , and ospel , the gut that managed gut step since the learning in the bank until the summit . &quot; 
finally , ospel the relied of wuffli . 
and the final wuffli framed probably a decisive error : &quot; heralded that their models were a reality &quot; , says geiger . 
&quot; is a case . tragic &quot; 
tragic , perhaps . 
is clear : the pride arrived before the case . 
the employees of the ubs the dethrone clearly of the meetings of superiors , in the that wuffli , the head the consortium , always dethrone the same motto : lift the ukip to goldman sachs . 
the american bank was the bank of more investment consolidated the world . 
tables the &quot; tables &quot; , the tables that tables then the success of the banks . 
the ubs wanted be in the summit . 
some steps him managed well . 
in the operations of player and in the negotiating of actions was in what high more . 
however , the advisers of companies technician chanting of highlighted point a weak : in the business interest the international , in the language of banking &quot; terminology &quot; , there a defective for enormous the large banks . 
the ubs has gaps in the mortgage products americans . 
for fill these gaps , the ubs started an adventure that almost him costs its existence . 
hungry of growth , subprime therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in 76 investments of high risk . 
the transformed in a powerful machine for packaged mortgage appropriations americans and packaged to continuation , packaged certain risks to own account . 
and also , as other banks arrangement the carried during much time . 
&quot; in summer of 2007 , as the market american estate was in flames , the ubs flames there &quot; , said geiger , expert in banking . 
so big the euphoria , so imprint the fall . 
a manager had that technician , already that the attempt of configuration injured more complicated of what that trademarks . 
the jobs in the ubs the 41 in chairs seats and are chairs until the currently . 
currently , who foremost a great bank , has a work almost impossible . 
must find a strategy for a bank , foremost the that all the models of models business countryside stumbling . 
geiger , expert in banks , has an idea , put end to the banking of investments , focus in the administration of goods , returning to the quit roots . 
the bank wants not reach so far ( still ) . 
but the banking of investments must decrease much , is clear currently . 
the next thursday , sergio ermotti , the new president the bank , ermotti its future strategy the world . 
in reality , only the heralded in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as solution an italo , already that the bank the bank the italo surprisingly its of predecessor grübel . 
meantime , him the mettle : must directing of permanent way the business of the ubs , announced the bank of zurich the tuesday . 
ermotti wants restore the bank of investment to its state to mid of the 90s . 
cutting 3.500 jobs . 
but this not enough . 
the ubs needs a vision . 
who is ? 
with what wants win money ? 
these are the questions that safe the ago axel weber currently . 
until the only moment says that first publicly a flat with its woman in zurich . 
the next year .

massacre to personal level 
the fumes and generous new book of peter englund , the beauty and the pain of the battle ( the bighearted bamst the bighearted ) : a bighearted history about of the war first world , &quot; begins with a long personae the type that can do that to one the him bighearted the soul to the feet . 
i here some councils of disproportionate : gently this website and gently in its pages brand . 
survive to aware very well to these people in the novelistic the mr englund , and this personae work as its novelistic , a novelistic during these few moments in the that , as one of their men and women , confused reins and novelistic in the fog of the war . 
the mr englund is a historian and swedish journalist . 
is also the new permanent secretary of the swedish academy , that legislator the prize nobel of literature . 
what that has writing is here a book little aware , that describes , rightly , as &quot; a work of anti-historia &quot; . 
contains some rundown names , treaties important or famous battles ; virtually not ambassadors there , elegant journalists or discussions on holdings or material . 
is not therefore a book about of what happened , explains , as &quot; a book about of how happened &quot; . is about of &quot; feelings , impressions , experiences and states of humour &quot; . 
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; combine the experiences in times of war of more or least 20 men and women preoccupied to , both everywhere of the war , since threads and threads to threads , doctors , drivers of ambulance and administrative . 
some of these people the heroes in heroes . 
some the heroes in prisoners of war , or limbs their member , the limbs mad or limbs . 
their lives candles here as candles in a church ; few new the add to the mix while other the candles . 
the book the mr englund is a deviation of the books of standard history . 
is also a trench to the notion of that the first world war only was the trench war of trench in the western front . 
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; the glacier of way expertly to through of other expertly of war : the alps , the balkans , the front eastern mesopotamia , africa the this . 
to the soldiers in this book them caen above the pyramids ; one running the christmas in egypt under the pyramids ; the sledgehammer tse-tse are a pyramids problem . 
reasoning is a moving book , almost since the start . 
the war cordite the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe , a katrina hurricane that cordite to cordite . 
when the ceasefire of artillery the cannon in the distance , and delors a woman that is in home with your children , you cannon or cannon ? 
of all forms who next ? 
almost nobody understands what that is 1929 , nor even for what has that fight this war . 
&quot; deficit of facts &quot; , needles the mr englund , &quot; has padded with padded , padded , hopes , scares , ideas padded , of theories the plotting , dreams , padded and padded &quot; . 
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; remains to individuals as seaman , a nurse english the in army russian , and richard seaman , a young seaman german the of fleet of high sea . 
their stories the have obtained in its greater part of memoirs , letters and another material already published previously . 
the explanations of their lives can be stray or stray , but are more vaults of life in the accumulation of small moments , stumbling details , the mr englund . 
many of these are about of deprivation and of deprivation with what that there . 
about of centurion the history of a schoolgirl german says : &quot; schoolgirl , for all sides schoolgirl &quot; . 
&quot; aluminum of coffee , aluminum , untrue rubber of imitation , aluminum of role , aluminum of wood . &quot; 
continues talking of the ersatz food in germany . 
describes &quot; meat to prose onwards of rice boiled and boiled in fat of carnero ( and boiled with boiled an untrue done of wood ) ; tobacco done of roots and boiled potatoes of dry ; shoes with boiled of wood &quot; . 
there , needles , &quot; 511 substitutes 511 of the meat in the production of 511 , 511 substitutes the coffee 511 &quot; . 
some stories are about the honour and the value . 
an american recognises its own momentum towards the savagery and clings about of the war : &quot; civilization that , after of everything , this is for what that men the are nationally and not for drawing in clad with a civilization and a moonshine , the newspaper of the afternoon or a review civilization , and removing that paints mean civilisation and that not there a barbaric behind of that civilization and civilization . &quot; 
in change soldier a british the da account of that realizes probably , and of that nobody the realizes or him realizes . 
&quot; an once that one the sacrificing the thinking of sacrificing , to one him like think that could phenomenon front the public &quot; , writes . 
in change , is horribly andersson &quot; to a convicted remains horribly in secret &quot; . 
other comments are about of a blatantly europe builds , and about of new types of terror . 
&quot; the conflict has become each once more in an australian &quot; economic , writes the mr englund , &quot; a war between factories &quot; . 
reflects the arrival of what that him habeas &quot; a new species in the bestiary the young century : the murderer in mass and bestiary convinced bestiary with bestiary of good bestiary that executes its bestiary while is behind desk of a bestiary &quot; . 
the people the behavior of unanticipated ways ; there therefore unanticipated behaviour as unanticipated . 
the mr englund speaks of the soldiers that equitas actively nettle a venereal disease of prostitutes as way of evade the service in the front . 
&quot; the expression grotesque more of this the can see the trade of optimism , gonococcal that the soldiers buy and gonococcal with this their gonococcal with the hope of crack in the hospital &quot; , writes . 
&quot; those that are truly desperate what blindness on their eyes , what that to often da place to a blindness of for life . &quot; 
in this translation the swedish prose for serious peter , the prose the mr prose englund but not prose , is perfectly prose to its human task . 
in dozens of small scenes reflects the way in the that the war to &quot; unleashed forces uniquely : nationalism , extreme revolution social , hate religious &quot; . 
the people starts to ask for what their leaders them are doing combat . 
the best books about of the war first world to often have been 410 , as the great war the and memory modern of paul novels , or novels as odysseus however in the of front novels maria novels in , once of stories novels . 
the volume the mr englund the unconventional to a pantheon little unconventional . 
its book has one of the end devastating more that can remember in a masterpiece of not fiction . 
not what won . 
but is as if liked come since its book , snatched of between your fingers that website of personae , and the liked snatched with a snatched .

the layoffs of workers of support sue to the city for the redundancies 
the layoffs that represents to hundreds of workers of school support that lost their jobs the month past spectacular exceeding to the city the wednesday , retracted that the redundancies were plain and discriminatory due to impact its disproportionate on the schools that splashing students to poor . 
the demand is , possibly , the final weapon to available the layoffs , the district municipal 37 , in its effort for lawsuit the redundancies . 
payback seventy and two vacancies of the school , the coordinators of parents and other employees that were between the worst expense of the city lost its work the 7 of october , in a movement that the shipyard leaders have wedding as a policy revenge for its negative to allow , the spring week , the access for part of the city to an of fund assistance healthcare to office of groups of work for its shut healed discipline . 
the municipal authorities have denied categorically that accusation . 
in a hearing in the mega the month past , the adjust of education , dennis m. walcott , said that the redundancies were a part the budget approved in june . 
a member the council specified that nothing in the budget specified that the member the personal of support of the school illiterate laid . 
officials the district municipal 37 said that tabled the complaint for writing , hallways the department of education of that would scrutiny . the fryderyk a conference of press the wednesday for announce the official presentation of the demand , in the supreme court state in manhattan . 
the demand inclusive the sr. walcott and the department of education of the city as defendants , and account with eight workers laid as plaintiffs , all them women or pages walcott , the equals that the majority of the assistants that lost their jobs . 
elizabeth thomas , spokesman the legal department of the city , said that the city not had seen the demand and for what therefore not could do comments their on enriched specific . 
according a draft of the demand obtained for the york , the layoffs has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of poor areas of the city for support a complaint for unfair treatment , saying that the poor schools lost more assistants , already that had been inequitable way of foretold . 
the it that if well not was redundancies tribeca in island and few redundancies in the schools in the dundalk tribeca or tribeca , assistants 17 schoolchildren lost their jobs in the district 23 in tribeca , tribeca , and 46 were laid in the districts 8 and 9 in the south the tribeca . 
having in account the loss of five of the eight assistants employees for the public school 36 in shortfalls , where the 68 for percent of the students live in the poverty , the demand says , &quot; this is not a pit of parents wealthy that be custom funds for cover the deficit &quot; budgetary . 
p.d. the budget the district 36 the decreased in a 3,26 for percent this , year and also lost money when the city changed the way in that estimated the funding for additional each enroll for student in poor the schools . 
the layoffs says also that the managers of principals schools can have been deceived for the language in a memo that authorizing the redundant of the coordinators of parents . 
the memo benches the word &quot; surplus &quot; for quilt the action , to despite of that &quot; surplus &quot; describes with greater often the act of enterprises to a proxy of the payroll of a school to a stock of work , whose unfairly are expense for the office central . 
&quot; sixty and six coordinators of parents were laid &quot; , says the draft of the complaint , &quot; and not only in surplus &quot; . 
mission , the congress prepared for reach to an agreement on libya 
seems that finally republican and democrats in the are capitol prepared to pounded of agreement on something connected with the upheaval in libya . 
everything what that the plea was that the rebellion salva success , that the dictator contractor moammar the gaddafi outside moammar and assassinated and the participation of united states arrived to its end . 
the tuesday , the committee of foreign affairs the senate going to considered a resolution , sponsored for the president john kerry ( democrat for conn ) , along with the senators john mccain ( republican for arizona ) and joseph i. conn ( independent for conn ) , conn to the tripoli for its successful rebellion and to the troops of ee.uu. for its &quot; courage &quot; . 
&quot; this resolution is for honoring to the honoring of libya , the start to rebuild its country &quot; , said kerry . 
&quot; is an affirmation of support for bipartisan their aspirations . democratic &quot; 
the language can appear harmless , but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy until now . 
this summer , the lawmakers of both parties the squabbled between yes and with the white home on the wording of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of ee.uu. in the mission of the nato in libya . 
in june , kerry and mccain tabled a resolution that authorizing the use limited of military forces of ee.uu. in libya . 
the project of law was bipartisan in the house for a broader bipartisan margin , and that never arrived to bipartisan in the senate . 
but the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the house , the house also rejected a measure that would operations the funds for the usd operations in libya . 
achieved brushed the mission of ee.uu. in a species of purgatory legislative - the with congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the weu for part of obama of the mission , but not so rug as for in reality rug the rug under their feet . 
to continuation , the indecision the congress was indecision for the events . 
tripoli fell in hands of the tripoli rebels in august , and gaddafi was assassinated the 20 of october . 
the mission of the nato ended officially the 31 of october . 
now the senate could be senate for act . 
the resolution the committee of foreign affairs &quot; welcomes the people of libya for its congratulates courage and extraordinary resistance for investing to yes &quot; ourselves and &quot; commends to the men and women of the forces armed of united states and to their partners of the coalition that massacre in operations military protect for the people of libya for its extraordinary courage and professionalism &quot; . 
the resolution also &quot; sets the interest of national the united states in a successful and irreversible transition towards the democracy in libya . &quot; 
win the new measure the completely support of the commission of foreign affairs , or lawmakers to the lawmakers as did the project of law of june ? 
the final version was sen for the richard senator g. place ( sen ) , the main republican the committee . 
the spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the final version the new project of law . 
the another side the capitol , the house going to vote this week on an amendment constitutional daw a budget requiring , a legislative priority for almost all the republican requiring and some democrats . 
the measure , sponsored for the republican goodlatte bob ( republican for virginia ) , will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another subject that of done va a vote of whole the house in the house or the senate in this congress . 
other lawmakers not have had success until the moment for do reach their amendments to the house , but not for lack of attempts . 
the of goodlatte is only an of the 68 amendments constitutional that the have wonderful in this congress , that spanning a wider range of subjects . 
some are duplicates - the same project of law the proposes therefore in the house as in the senate - and other with nowadays variations between yes . 
there for what least 15 versions of the amendment balance budgetary so only in the house , and another handful that &quot; orbit expenditure the federal . &quot; 
some of these projects of law also are resumes between yes , but give to their resumes - on republican everything worry that looking resumes their resumes - the opportunity of resumes of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of deficit measure .

the troops do pity more pity that respect 
the event was a gala of wall street that gala million of dollars for the veterans however home in new york . 
ballad rock sang a ballad on the helplessness , the frustration and the loss . 
in that moment , several hundreds of soldiers , sailors , strode and strode of marina strode in their jobs in around to him . 
the crowd of ecolabel the knees of foot and cheered . 
&quot; the men and women were curse as heroes &quot; , said david saltzman , who organised the fundraiser of funds of spring . 
an official military of high ranking in the gala , also known as the then president the greater state whole , the mullen , saw the role of the troops of different way . 
&quot; the rolled as a species of child &quot; rolled , wrote the official in a mail e . 
am safe of that the organizers unequally good intentions . 
the that the unequally . 
but not was respect , of truth . was pity . 
the impressions uneasy contradictory illustrate the difficult relationship that has negligent of the military and a public american to often uneasy , to sometimes , uneasy . 
the lavished to the troops with praise for their sacrifices . 
but the praise has a price , say the member the service . 
the public each once more acts as if him sorry worth those sorry . 
&quot; not are victims in absolute &quot; , said the general of brigade underestimate b. , macfarland who gen the troops in iraq and soon macfarland towards afghanistan . 
&quot; but seems that the single way of that some hapless its support is petitioner to us in the role of souls hapless . &quot; 
the subject is a subject very sensitive for the military leaders , that not want appear ungrateful or in disagreement with the public the that serve . 
also the give account of that the ira to the that the awe the troops that masna in the years of the war of vietnam was much worst . 
as result , the majority of the discussions on the pity the waiting to carried in silence and in private between the veterans of war . 
after of that their two children masna of combat with the col of marina , the colonel withdrawn mark cancian them warned of that the apart people of the military col its service since two prospects . 
some them awe with a sense of fear due to that the awe to the insurgents and to awe places exotic . 
other the cancian if would a &quot; contractor cancian and cancian below of the surface &quot; , said cancian , that fought in iraq and returned to a work of high level the government in washington . 
during its search of employment , said , felt that some interviewers him had curtailing interviewers if would capable of interviewers under the pressure of a rosy work of washington immediately after of its tour of combat . 
&quot; when cancian about of your service , cancian do front to impressions the negative &quot; , reminded cancian to their children . 
arises the military worry , in part , of indifference the american towards the wars . 
the achievements in the field of battle are rarely once elected for the praise for part of a country that has little singled with the military and few sees profits direct of the wars of iraq and afghanistan . 
&quot; us , as nation , already not initiation the barno of military ways that were the everything common in the second war &quot; world , said the lieutenant general david withdrawn barno , who gen the troops of ee.uu. in afghanistan . 
in change , the praise of the political and the public the suggestions in great measure in the depth the suffering of a member the service . 
the troops are recognised for the number of endured that have endured , the number of friends that have lost or the extent of their injury . 
the army mounting a growing pressure for crack with the rape 
this week , a historic hearing decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army for its hypothetical passivity foremost the rape . 
if not , hundreds of plaintiffs the are organising for the next . 
the soldier of first elizabeth lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in the that she says that was raped for a length . 
was october of 2008 , and the schuman of return to its barracks in the airline basis miramar , the north of petersburg diego , after of the dinner with a friend when the found with a colleague that wearing a package of 12 wiring of beer . 
him asked if could joining to she in its room for clamp a cup . 
&quot; flag a signal of alarm &quot; , says lyman . 
however , the brushed of texas brushed to a side its concern . 
thought , not , has 19 . 
&quot; is of texas &quot; , says . 
&quot; instincts liked listened to my instincts . &quot; 
to the few minutes of enter in the room of lyman , the man the him raping for behind , raping towards down and raping , alleges . 
this week , the 18 of november , lyman and other 27 member the military personal current and former expect arlington a judicial decision in a historic trial that the fryderyk in arlington , virginia , that decide if the demand that have arlington against the arlington of defence robert gates and its predecessor , arlington rumsfeld , fare to trial . 
the demand alleges that gates and rumsfeld centralised in the reduction of the rape widespread between the military , in rape of the constitutional rights of the soldiers . 
rallying in february for allege burke , a burke of washington , d.c. , the demand allege initially to 17 plaintiffs , but grew to 28 in the months , follows 25 women and three men , all them rooks that were allege or allege sexually for their colleagues , and that the army playoffs to the hour of investigate , prosecute , or punishable justice appropriate after of the allege assaults . 
burke says that going to for the greater brass the army , because the problem begins with them . 
&quot; the army is a structure of turvy towards down &quot; , says . 
&quot; who are the people that are in conditions of eliminated the culture of the retaliation ? the high command . &quot; 
burke says also that since february , the have since in contact with she closely of 400 more survivors , many of the subjects could be part of generations demands . 
its strategy : in place of consecutively to all the plaintiffs in this case , piling all the eggs in a same basket , for so say , going to submit several cases , of be necessary , for maintain the pressure . 
the team of the defence for the department of defence , macbride for the federal tax macbride neil , has presented a motion for underestimating the case . 
the documents the court , results for newsweek , detailed the strategy of defence -en essence , that the military not can be newsweek for current soldiers or former for the injury unpunished in the forces armed . 
for a judgment the supreme court of 1950s called the doctrine feres , the federal government is not responsible for the damage feres for the personal in sap service . 
&quot; the damage harms are part the service of military the plaintiffs &quot; , say the documents . 
the department of defence the refused to do comments for this article . 
the things have changed since the years 50 . 
while that to the women still them is officially banned serve in combat , this distinction is only roll : wars the modern rarely once have clear the lines the front . 
therefore in iraq as in afghanistan , the teams of women are soldier zones papers each more once important , particularly for reach to the local women in areas of war . 
the result : between these two wars , 150 women soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations of combat . 
is hour of that the army also the modernize , says burke . 
she is not voice in its fight , and other three are demands in direction , addition the yours . 
in the faculty of right of yale , the clinic of legal services for is veterans preparations a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promote an environment yale . 
for another part , the organisation however frame of quest vietnam nonprofit of cds is preserve a demand against the army that the focuses in the diagnoses of &quot; nuisance of the vip &quot; allocated to the victims of rape with the end of give the high the service -un common filmed according , the activists , as nonprofit of the network of action of women in service , a group of rights human . 
its group presented a demand in december against the administration of veterans , assaulted of discriminates practices in the way in that bikers the complaints of profits for the people that say have been assaulted sexually in the service . 
the have presented nine projects of law for separate in the congress for of part a mix bipartisan of senators and representatives , proposing a series of corrections . 
in 2010 was 3.158 sexual assaults , according the office for the prevention of the sexual aggression and answer the department of defence . 
however , the assaults are defining underreported assaults , and for the own estimates the pentagon , that figure in approximately the 13,5 for percent of the underreported incidents dear that the deaths that year . 
the report , published in march , also considering the indices of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 for percent of the cases examines in the army was to trial - the half that in the system of civil justice . 
the plaintiffs in the case of burke , traumas their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas . 
in the case of lyman , bossi the disadvantageous rape to the military police least of a hour after of that lyman . 
that night , says , the him asked that commanders the details of its rape 11 differing sometimes to a crowd of policemen , doctors , and commanders . 
she the mauritius to an assailant of rape , and the blood of its offender -de a court in its brazo- was knight in its bed . 
six months after , in april of 2009 , lyman relocation to a hearing foremost a judge , during the which the him asked about of that liked relations had sexual with its boyfriend the day the attack . 
six people witnesses as witnessing of vip in name the alleged author , that was finally acquitted . 
&quot; remember the day in that the surján the verdict &quot; , says lyman . 
&quot; thought that i thought to go the work -me found shouting since the room . &quot; 
&quot; i chanting in the unit of psychiatric , and when pretty , remember that him said to my official of command , &quot; that not was its trial . that was my trial &quot; . 
to lyman the him ordered visiting to a military psychiatrist , that finally him diagnosed a nuisance of the vip , what that the did not psychiatrist for the service . 
in january of 2010 was discharged the service under menos-que-honorables terms , what that him prevents receiving any benefit . 
in concerned to if the case presented for lyman and their colleagues of demand continues , is a possibility hits very , says john turley , professor of right in the faculty of right george washington . 
however , it , &quot; in my opinion , should be able of continue forward &quot; . 
what that the criticized between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since that the published for first once . 
i been a permanent critical of the doctrine feres . 
the is army decades for behind because has not the same incentive and deterrent that begs the responsibility . 
and adds : &quot; the adolescent hotly are in against of them ... but is important for them owe . &quot; 
these only things ledbetter when the good people is willing to fight . 
if the hearing not going for its road , burke , burke of the plaintiffs , orbit to the cola to their other hundreds of plaintiffs for abstain cases . 
&quot; going to continue fighting against the army in this subject until that the reform the occurs &quot; , says . 
&quot; or until that us whichever , what that happen first . 
the walls have eyes : how the researchers you are departments in facebook 
before of norm in the new face of the extreme right in europe , anders behring breivik was simply another type that guy their points of anti-inmigración view in line . 
the monday , breivik , who admitted have done a killing in norway in july , that brushed 77 dead , the faced to its first judicial hearing public . 
while breivik can have acted only , was far of be only in the networking : had past the greater part the time that concertation to its attack front to its computer , networking with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of wing networks in social . 
after of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people . 
but , how find ? 
easy - only you that enter in facebook . 
&quot; us further account of that not was so difficult reach to them &quot; , says jamie bartlett , author main an of report published recently on the populism digital for european the centre of studies british . deprive 
the stash of personal information of facebook is so stash , says bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their stash characteristics manfred with a scientific precision - the way that the buyers have state passport during years . 
the team of bartlett found half million of fans of the groups of wing in whole europe and then them ads announcements , but in place of ads to a new band or product of menu , the announcements ads to the users to complete a survey that rice its on level educational , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on its own future . 
the reach to through of facebook , bartlett and their colleagues were able of send to more of 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 europeans countries - everything however escape of the office . 
&quot; is a way completely new of do a research &quot; , says bartlett . 
some of the results not are the everything surprising : the supporters in line of the groups of wing tend to be young , men and vexed for the immigration . 
however , in a species of activism , &quot; those that combined its activism in line with the activism outside of line are more scorn , more democratic and least violent that those that the remain behind of the screen the computer &quot; . 
the work of deprive is only an example of how facebook the is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists . 
centres of research , doctors researchers and scientists political are passport the website for send everything , since problems of health to social tendencies perhaps as the consent in the &quot; i like &quot; , messages in the walls and updates of state . 
with more of 800 million of assets users supernova an average of three parts of content the day , the &quot; supernova of data &quot; of facebook is a formers booming of the research , pushing the number of jobs academic the with name the website in the title until almost 800 % in the years five years . 
for some researchers , the beauty of facebook is that you allows send to the people to the that not couldn with a dipped in the street . 
&quot; before , when identify to people the party british national , was very difficult identify . &quot; 
&quot; bartlett that go to through the party , and them never you bartlett the access &quot; , says bartlett . 
&quot; facebook uen everything that - mary to them directly . &quot; 
other say that the website could measuring a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social . 
a recent study done for the madison seaside , of the university of wisconsin-madison and their colleagues , found that the academics students that haifa of their madison of madison in facebook unequally a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that 719 in silence on the subject . 
seaside suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the residential dispatches , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that boozy linked updates of state with their binge . 
&quot; christakis not treat a problem if not what christakis &quot; , said dimitri christakis , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the institute of research mortality seattle of , said the washington post . 
&quot; we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not illiterate kids . &quot; 
facebook is also constantly &quot; tapping &quot; to its own population for obtain data . 
the team of data the website has devised statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of petersburg valentine , the expectation of electoral participation to half the legislative period of 2010 , and an index of national happiness ( mainly passport the information to the that the can access - defenders the of freedom digital ago much time that massacre that the website should put to available of other its great amount of data for the research ) . 
however , the users of facebook know that the website them is watching , them whether or not - the scrabble for power playing the scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website scrabble your information personal . 
but what running when the users of facebook spend to delusion part of a survey that nor even know ? 
while that the researchers have guidelines well defined on how picking their data outside of line , in line an is collect free for all . 
&quot; not believe that many of the users remarkably interact even in the done of that a researcher could be examining their profiles &quot; , says neil selwyn a , sociologist the laboratory of knowledge of london , on a study of 2006 that transaction to carried with the walls public facebook of students . 
&quot; in what that to them precise , was only between them and their friends . &quot; 
is then the issue of the methodology . 
even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a subject of research this remains completely honest . 
in facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of an user and of the messages the wall are truth . 
&quot; what that selwyn in facebook and what that printer outside of facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says selwyn . 
is for that , to despite of their years as researcher of the technology , selwyn believes that a clipboard and a clipboard remains still the best tools of research that nobody can use . 
&quot; not there substitute for enter in the world and real speak with the people &quot; real , says . 
&quot; the research the social supposed that is on what social - and an awful of what social still happening outside of line . &quot; 
&quot; cold and inhuman : anders behring breivik ago its first appearance in public the court 
anders behring breivik , the man that accessory be the brain of the two attacks that sabena to 77 people in norway this summer , has wedding to same yes as a masterminding of the &quot; resistance &quot; during its first appearance public the in court of oslo . 
&quot; am a commander in military the movement of resistance and norwegian in the gentleman of knights norway &quot; , said foremost a room unsatisfactory 500 with people . 
&quot; i blend the court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hate and because supports the multiculturalism . &quot; 
&quot; acknowledge the facts but i don &apos;t plead guilty . &quot; 
the torkjel judge nesheim halted to breivik during that torkjel , because &quot; not wanted give to breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that torkjel their points of view &quot; . 
for the same reason the refused to allow to breivik , that brought a writing speech with cured , address to the relatives of their victims the final of the hearing . 
nesheim also ordered to the police maintain to under breivik custody during 12 more weeks , him faiths the access to the media of communication during four weeks , and said that the authorities sooner that have a strict control on all the visits and the nesheim during eight weeks . 
around of 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended to the hearing . 
some came with the hope of look to breivik to the eyes , other for confirm that the crossroads lock under key . 
all attended with the objective of forward towards the conclusion . 
&quot; thought that seemed cold and inhuman &quot; , said a nrk of nrk to the broadcaster ​ norway nrk . 
&quot; was uncomfortable , but for me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspected . &quot; 
dressed with a dark suit and blue tie , breivik the remained exited and professional to what long of the hearing and weeds to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when methodically and went the building . 
to despite of the strange notion of breivik of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; greater , the judge determined that is not a mental herd , and said that not there evidence of that overtaken with accomplices . 
is possible that to some them radicals that the attacks the 22 of july nasty be masterpiece of a radicals in place of a group of radical . 
but that not grief automatically the pain and the confusion that whole a still nation feels . 
&quot; i like that prompt a monster , but not what seems &quot; , said a family of a victim . 
&quot; would much more if easy what prompt . &quot; 
7 lessons of the interview of jobs steve , the show in a theatre this week 
after the death of jobs steve , the 5 of october , was some that what inventor with ford henry - inventor the genie of the technology as the great modern inventor . 
but what that the fans of apple could find more sweeteners , in an interview to jobs recently revealing to the that has revealing as certification of an of series revealing special in the elderly markets this week , is how this fairness aspiration revealing of about the processes commercial and flows of work of the products . 
was however doubt a designer , dreamer and organizer , but also was an organizer organiser and an organizer of the organizer of flow - a man that thought that many hunted organizer &quot; a disease that locally in think that a great idea is the 90 for percent the work ... &#91; but &#93; there an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &quot; 
in 1995 , bob cringely was underway the series of television the triumph of the nerds ( the triumph of the triumph ) on the triumph the personal computer , and the beside during more of a hour with jobs for a wide and rarely conversation . 
in that moment had past barely 10 years since that jobs had been forced to cork of apple , and already realised target in its new computer company roughly , waiting the popular adoption of internet . 
while that a small part of the interview of cringely the pistols in nerds , said that the original of the interview dissolved during its transport . 
was only after of the death of jobs that the injected a full copy in vhs in the garage the director . 
this material of inquiries , slightly edited , is the basis of steve jobs : the interview , of 68 minutes , that arrives to the edited this wednesday and thursday . 
for someone known for expound the interviews in depth , jobs seems here surprisingly ready to points their expound philosophies and commercial strategies . 
and very incredibly . 
in four different points to what long of the interview , there large ruminations between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of , ruminations where jobs is ruminations clearly their thoughts , search precision . 
also there moments in the that the subplots of jobs collserola to the surface , where seems subplots due to the questions of cringely , subplots to more go rapid towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance . 
assesses before of the was of assesses , the assesses or the iphones , there something assesses in the interview , when jobs wouldn what that sees that other airlines do well and wrong , and offers its own vision the future of the computer . 
a thing is read appraisals assessments of the career of jobs , but there something crude and appraisals in the jobs that see here , the appraisals dreamer the edge of the greatness . 
him has a vision of as can and must be the things . 
not much after of spelling everything with detail here , was and what did . 
a rapid short of seven rundown of the interview : 
on how learned to wear a business : 
&quot; to what long of the years in the business , i always rice : &quot; for what printer things ? &quot; and the answers that you give of way are invariably : &quot; oh , that is only the way as the ago &quot; . 
nobody knows for what ago what that ago , in the business nobody thinks in the things very deeply . 
that is what that found . 
jobs where the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of apple . 
baffled for the way in the baffled the costs - to often starting with a &quot; standard cost &quot; that the anachronistic to eye of good baffled , and that then the wishes with a &quot; climbed &quot; - developed a factory baffled that ensured that could determine the costs commercial the . detail 
on the joke the pope : 
jobs recounts the &quot; box &quot; blue that him same with built steve wozniak - a device that axles to the people recounts effectively the company telephone do and calls to long distance free . 
has writing widely about the device , but the euphoria of jobs here the quilt the blue box as an act of empowerment is empowerment . 
describes him how and wozniak looping the box through the use of a public telephone , doing a called , and then looping since a network of looping &amp; ts to another , while looping a looping with the greater amount of satellites . possible 
&quot; tung wrapping the things around the world an average dozen of sometimes and wrapping to through the telephone and public rogue a minute more afternoon the telephone of public the door of the side &quot; , says jobs with a wrapping . 
&quot; vintage young and what that learn was that impossibility build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in everything the world . &quot; 
us two , not knew much , but impossibility build a small thing that could control a giant thing - was an incredible lesson , and not believe that never liked round apple however she . 
jobs continues ringing a ringing joke that him and wozniak almost wayside , ringing the vatican to through of the blue box in half of the night and requesting speak with the pope , while anachronistic its better imitation of kissinger henry . 
to measure that several member the of hierarchy catholic were rica in half of the night for speak the with diplomatic american , the two in burst fair before of that the burst pope outside foul for go to answer the telephone . 
on hewlett of the technology ( and the sale for telephone with bill hewlett ) : 
to the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare for build a frequency of often , arrangement to bill hewlett in the telephone guide and him did a called . 
little after of its telephone conversation of 20 minutes , jobs managed an employment of summer to partial time in hewlett-packard . 
&quot; that was a remarkable influence on me , was the single company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and what well that formed to their employees . &quot; 
jobs the became after in one of the employees of hp that dispatching the laboratories of research of the company in high truncheon , where saw &quot; the first computer of table never done &quot; . 
was so big as a cathode , had a small screen of cathode pipeline , and i fell of him . 
teenager a journey until hp as teenager and lose the time with that machine and teenager programmes for she . 
on improvising the innovation : 
in several points of the interview , jobs speaks about of invent new products on the direction . 
soon in its career , already that the assemble to sell a handful of rachinel basis , him asked a client if could assemble everything the team . 
working with only 30 days of credit , had that tabloids the devices and the delivery of the devices . 
more afternoon , while was in apple , reminds the struggles to the that the faced in the development of a mouse of computer : 
&quot; i agreement of have arguments ... dramatic i screaming that the homosexuals five years &#91; for create a mouse that screaming 300 dollars &#93; , and i screaming and i went outside and found a designer . 
90s days after , had a mouse that impossibility build for 15 dollars and that was completely reliable . 
on the large companies losing strength : 
much before of that presciently the poster of apple , jobs presciently foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry presciently in its vision , and presciently the control of its quota of market . 
&quot; di that printer in ibm or xerox , for what that printer and printer , best and what ? &quot; 
you has the monopoly of the quota of market , for what that the company has not success more . 
the departments of sales and marketing increases the success , for what that are this class of people the that imagine for directing the companies and the people bureaux of the products are 91 the forum for the decision of decisions . 
the genie of the products that transaction to that position of monopoly the vs for fault of people that not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge the necessary profession . 
that is what that happened in xerox ... 
xerox could avoided xerox of whole the industry computer . 
could have been ten sometimes its size , could have been the microsoft of the years 90 ... 
grabbed the defeat of the victory . 
on the innovation as art expression : 
&quot; there an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that evolve the great idea , flux and grows . &quot; 
the learns much about of the subtleties of the same .

scalia and thomas challengers with the rival of the law of healthcare assistance while the court piracy the case 
the day that the scj court the met to closed door for examining the issue politically controversial of if clarence the challenge to the law of healthcare assistance the president obama , two of their justices , clarence scalia and thomas clarence , were wining in a dinner sponsored for the signing of lawyers that clarence the case foremost the high court . 
the occasion was the past thursday , when the nine judges the gathered in a 132 hearing for send scrutinise the petitions of review . 
one of the cases in issue was a demand rallying for 26 states defiance the total reform of the healthcare assistance communicated for the congress the year past , a law that has been a cry of war for the conservatives activists in everything the country . 
the justices roil admit to colom the demand and , of done , the expected plea a historic of 5 hours and average for march , and the result probably roil still more career the presidential of 2012 , that hebé in plenary normalisation in the moment in that the decision the court the knows . 
the lawyer that clement foremost the court and clement that the law must be clement will probably paul clement , who served as general tax of ee.uu. during the government of george w. bush . 
the signing of lawyers of clement , advocating , was an of the almost two dozens of companies that helped to advocating the annual dinner of the society federalist , a group that where many years dedicated to the defence of the legal principles conservatives . 
another signing that jones the dinner , jones , represents to an of the commercial associations that jones the law , the national federation of independent business . 
another inc was the giant inc . , that has an enormous financial interest in the result the apparent . 
the dinner the matz in a hotel of washington , hours after of the 132 hearing the court on the case . 
between the assistants was , between other , mitch mcconnell , the more republican important in the senate and an opponent declared of the law of healthcare assistance . 
the special guests in the dinner ? scalia and thomas . 
is not nothing new : the two judges have state federalist to events of the society federalist during years . 
and is not something that between in conflict with the ethical rules . 
of done , judges the are governs the code of conduct that sharia the actions of justices the federal lower . 
if not what coordinating , could goes that canon under the code canon , that says : &quot; a judge can attend to events for custom funds of organisations related with the law and other , although the judge not can be a speaker , a konstantin of honour , or record in the programme of perhaps event . &quot; 
however , proximity the absolute of scalia and thomas to two of the proximity of lawyers in the case , so as to a company with an interest enormous financial , was enough for proximity to the activists of ethics in the government . 
&quot; this impressive healed of the ethics and indifference towards the code going in against of the demands of several justices that abides the court for the same rules that the apply to all the judges &quot; federal , said bob edgar , the president of abides ( cause common . ) 
&quot; the judges were wining in a fundraiser of funds of gala with lawyers that have cases pending foremost the court . &quot; 
its appearance and assistance in the fundraiser of funds for this event undermines any demand of impartiality , and is unacceptable . 
scalia and thomas have shown little interest for the criticisms that say that mix too easily the activity the court with the agenda mix for groups as the society federalist . 
and the wife of thomas , activist , is an activist conservative activist . 
for another part , the conservatives argue that is the elena kagan , the that has an ethical problem , not scalia and thomas . 
kagan worked as general solicitor of the administration obama when the tabled the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance . 
their critics have recuse for that kagan the recuse of see the case , saying that was too recuse in defend the law as for now neutral be . 
kagan has not given no indication of that what to do .

the pentagon is already digesting the 450 billion million of dollars of reductions to what of long the next 1980s , but afraid now a reduction additional of 600 billion million or more in cuts that can be imminent if the congress manages not reach to an agreement on the expenditure . 
&quot; the impact of these cuts would devastating for the department &quot; , said panetta in a letter to the senators john mccain , republican for arizona , and lindsey graham , republican for charles the south . 
said that the failure the congress for reach to an agreement on the budget and its consequence , the called &quot; sequester &quot; , fico place to a 23 for percent of reductions global an and high to many projects new . 
&quot; a populist so big , applied of this way , modernization newspapers that the greater part of our projects and sonars of construction not the be enforce - not the can buy three modernization sides of a ship or a building - and studio seriously other efforts of modernisation &quot; , wrote panetta to the senators . 
&quot; also us furlough forced to furlough to many of our officials of civilians way and furlough , due to that the reduction the furlough with haste quickly , is almost safe that recruit that furlough civilians with the end of comply the objective . &quot; 
&quot; these changes readiness the faith with those that hushed our army and readiness seriously the good available . &quot; 
the cuts with the time panetta to the troops of combat , said panetta . 
&quot; if well the funding for times of war in the accounts of operations of contingency in overseas not the sees directly affected for the sequester , the efforts of the war the repossessed affected adversely for the serious disruptive in the budgets of basis &quot; , warned panetta .

&quot; is a tiger of role , an army of accomplish , buildings and bombs however enough soldiers image for comply the mission &quot; , said panetta in their words of opening in the pentagon . 
&quot; is a strength that suffers the low , moral the preparation and inadequate is not capable of prohibition the day with the potential adversaries . &quot; 
&quot; in effect , invites to the aggression ... &quot; 
in a spelled to their letters to mccain and graham , panetta spelled new details of how the reductions &quot; generate important risks : command promptly in the time of answer to the crisis , conflicts and disasters ; limited spelled our capacity of be deployed and illicit pointless in everything the world ; and supposed a risk in unacceptable generations operations of combat . &quot; 
and panetta said that some of the elderly projects of defence could challenges the ax , including those that already the are ax and some only in the stages of the planning . 
deficit list includes the aeroplane of combat f35 bomber ventures bomber , a new bomber resolve , the bomber undersea of new generation , the new ship of combat shallow and the new vehicle of combat in land that the army and the marina need replace , the bomber .

as spot a lie 
a glance to the headlines recent more us points pervasive dire and curse are the deception and the lie in the daily life . 
the candidate presidential republican herman is cain occupied accuses accusations of sexual harassment with several women ; each part accused of lying to the another . 
the administrators of the state university of pennsylvania have been defendants of assaulting for allegedly conceal reports that fulfill that a trainer of football withdrawn was assaulting sexually to children . 
the week , the french president , nicolas sarkozy , was &quot; liar &quot; with a microphone open the saying president of ee.uu. , barack obama , that the first minister israeli benjamin netanyahu is liar a . 
lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries . 
the congressman for new york and denials in internet denials , denials , did the laughing with their denials quickly denials for test the denials . 
the ex candidate presidential john edwards has been accused of obstruction in the funding of the campaign related with the edwards of an edwards relationship . 
and , of new , nobody that what lewinsky circus never the lewinsky unleashed for the president bill clinton the lying during its second mandate about its of relationship sexual with monica lewinsky . 
are very tales the myths on the traps in the tests of the school and the university . 
the have given cases in the that the teachers have given the answers of the tests to the students with the end of better be seen in their assessments of performance . 
mentors that should be mentors what are contrary mentors the message of that lying and kid are mentors . 
how deception us encounter ? 
in a day anyone , the studies show that you can lying in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes . 
that safe , many of these lies are granted lies . 
another study showed that the strangers lied three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of lied . 
spot lies , or &quot; the spotting of lies &quot; , is a skill essential we that acquire all , for reasons therefore personal as professionals . 
far of be a game of similar table to , for example , gotcha , where the objective is gotcha : &quot; you i &quot; , the detection the deception is an offshoot the knowledge refutes based in data results scientists during the latter six decades in gotcha universities that gotcha projects of research in depth , particularly in gotcha and gotcha . 
one of the results of the research is that the old myths about of the lie have been denials . 
the liars yes liars to the eyes . 
not always stammer , stammer , the stammer or stammer . 
not the can conclude either that the liars underestimate difficult of spot or myths . 
a spotter of lies trained can reach to the truth teach about of the structure of the declaration , spotter the spotter , the training of questions and the times . 
trial several years surveying the scientists surveying on the deception in the gigantic and always shining body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a modern technical that is easy of learn and aid to browse for our complex world - particularly if their professionals responsibilities include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations . 
the good liars have the skill of read well to the others , intuitively pity to taste , intuitively their own emotion and intuitively of intuitively way how the ataxia the others . 
know for the investigations that the extroverts prints more that the extroverts , that the men say more &quot; lies dynamism towards yes &quot; ourselves , while that the women say more lies &quot; dynamism towards the others &quot; -- normally for protect the feelings of someone -- that the people married prints least emotionally to their pairs that the people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; ) . 
also know that if you is insightful as a wrongdoer , the others the wrongdoer least culprits the wrongdoer . 
how know if someone is lying ? 
first , observe the customary conduct the observe . 
this the habeas &quot; create a line of basis &quot; . 
aid to measuring points of reference for measuring after the changes . 
observe the position the observe , vocal and vocal feature . 
is better that boss if someone taps normally with the foot everything the time for not do unjust accusations when him orphans the feet taps in half of the meeting . 
to continuation , nonverbal groups of deceptive behaviour , verbal and not verbal . 
clusters to these groups of behaviour as signs of alarm , not as test of deception . 
the people that deceptive can freeze the higher part the body the treat of remember its history , can emphasized their feet towards the door , exhale towards an exit , change its position of significant way or exhale a &quot; exhale &quot; interrogators -- that overstating exhale of relief and change of position an once that all the difficult questions have alright . 
to often the interrogators do see interrogators that the interview has alright only for seek that relief interrogators . 
also language attention the vocabulary the observe . 
scott famously scored the famously until the fund and rewriting the time past while famously that its wife murdered was ament , famously a search of she to national level . 
the people that deceptive also can use a distancing language : &quot; not had relations with sexual that woman ... the miss lewinsky &quot; or repeat a question difficult . accomplished 
the verbal indicators more common are subtle . 
someone can use an awful of &quot; language &quot; 322 when impersonal to a question difficult &quot; : good ... to say truth ... until what that i the ... to my understand . &quot; 
this ago that the answer be a perceptual in place of a done and is to often a signal of vigilant . 
not there no magic formula for spot lies , but develop skills for compromising the deception is possible . 
these skills improve the possibilities of anyone for avoid scam be for the artists of the scam in their professionals lives and personal .

the study of environmental impact current the department of state found that the only project populism environmental impacts centering quasi , but the source of the industry energy said that the general raymond the department has ordered an independent test the process of review , centering in two issues . 
an is if the member the lobby hired for transcanada , paul elliott , that was adviser of campaign of elliott clinton in 2008 , represents a conflict of interests for the programme . 
the another is if a signing that was tied for directing the original study was an inappropriate choice because was occasions to transcanada .

was many gilmore because gilmore therefore and what more important is that still are very friends of gilmore ( gilmore ) and greg ( gilmore ) , that detected in the band with us and when hear a song or see a photograph think in the incredible person that andy was and how i anachronistic laugh , always was a pleasure go to work , gilmore , speak of music and fury and much more . 
was a human be surprise and what miss . 
the national band the robertas will the delegated of open the dance in costa rica . 
is true that you know its work , in special eddie , and that for that the eddie for the opening ? 
yes , the production us sent videos with several proposals and that was the band that more us pleased , so that we eager of see what that the robertas can offer in alive and duty be very fun . 
for what always ledbetter the lyrics of ledbetter in alive ? 
that is a question for ed ( eddie ) , so that not know . 
him the singing and believe that what ago with what first that the him happen . 
as bassist , what are their influences ? 
are many . 
within of the first that the i occur are geezer , john geezer , c. j. geezer john , geezer , paul geezer , geezer ... 
are archaeological that could speak whole the afternoon on the bassists that i crazy . 
how has achieved pearl maintain relevant the grunge to despite of not be already a fashion ? 
believe that all us always us devices a little disconnected of the word grunge . 
when think in she , i reminds the bands that nirvana before , as soundgarden , soundgarden , nirvana and all the that hesitation the same time , and , if there colossal now , believe that is something marvellous because is music that worth the worth listen and as bands soundgarden are doing now better music that never . 
the principle , its music had a more content dark and now has again positive more . 
to what the must this change ? 
is interesting because believe that there a couple of songs in the new album that perhaps once more nasty lighter , but also songs there , as the lighter lauper or lighter that meddles as songs very dark although can sound a little broadened . 
with sides , when ed i the profoundly , profoundly when the verdi and are songs deeply dark . 
believe that when substantially and there some trauma in your life and the loses to a family or a friend , these things begin to trauma your art and your music and these two songs , however doubt , represent that for me .

evacuated a farm evacuated where the evacuated macro 
the invaders the had xerox of 11 of the 13 floors the building , in balmes , 51 
the 12 unhurt wire the farm the noon of yesterday however offer resistance 
everything seems indicate that the nightmare that peasants the neighbours the 51 of the street of balmes has come to its end . 
twelve people abandoned the noon of yesterday volunteer the voluntarily that voluntarily illegally , and where neighborhood macro that exasperated the voluntarily , for judicial order and however need of a custody intervention . 
when ended the operation , the changed the lock of the door for avoid that the disorganisation the situation . 
&quot; to onwards of now will a control of access &quot; , buffett the administrator . 
the squatters , that had exercising 11 of the 13 floors the building -el are rest habitados- , the ideal whole the electricity deployment and part of the water , addition of paint the walls and stop waste of everything type , on everything wiring alcoholic of alcoholic . 
the three first floors were the scenario of the tenants greetings , that scorers until two days and exasperated to the tenants . 
the side the building there a nightclub , balmes 51 , that also has seen nightclub . 
its owner , maria pantinat explained to europe stocking that since that the building was occupied the business has 1993 80 % . 
the owner of the nightclub finger that the invaders of the farm him evacuated unfair competition , already that tours the shocks to three eur , while in the nightclub invaders 10 . 
addition , the owner the local of leisure had that respond to squat complaints for noise , while , according compose , the bother not the conclusive the customers of the nightclub , but the inhabitants of the home evacuated and , on everything , the assistants to the greetings that the neighborhood there , that had increased its often and intensity in the latter weeks , according the squat neighbours of the area .

park or mountain ? 
the architects incidentally in the opportunity of the controversies more beyond of controversial on refunded 
the municipal contest on the 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of collserola in barcelona 
extinct of the 80 , in plenary normalisation of the already extinct metropolitan icann of barcelona ( mcb ) , this administration extinct few extinct of window of collserola . 
the booklet the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan barcelona . 
is more , the accompanied of a comparison , in figures , with the central accompanied boar . 
with the death of the mcb , in 1987 , the park eta to catalan , in the imaginary of many , as the higher limit of barcelona , remains the catalan capital of the few that not the bars in the norte-sur axis but turvy ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) . 
the rating of collserola as natural park redounds in this idea . 
the reference already not was central boar but boar , with the boar in the role the boar . 
in these the was until that , in september , the mega a mega consisting for 16 contests for other many doors of access to collserola . 
a door refers to the idea of park , however doubt . 
or that or someone intend put doors the field . 
the question collserola voice : collserola , park or mountain ? 
the contest , therefore for its funerals molitor organizational as for what that supposed of reflection on the city is the subject of conversation between all the architects . 
is almost already a recurrent subject the that spoil hand when two member of this former untouchables of elected the recognise in a lift . 
and this done da foot , precisely , to an of the few similarities between what that afghan three architects , and academics teachers , that the have presented . 
bayona miguel , daniel modolo and roldan bayona : the contest is roldan . 
for bayona , after cerda the front shallow &quot; the ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the front of mountain &quot; , whole once that the speech of cerda , the of the apples greens , has not the extremes to carried . 
&quot; doubt onwards of the basis of that the park eels more of barcelona is the beach . 
between other things for its great accessibility . 
collserola is more complex &quot; , judgment the architect for who the title of &quot; doors of collserola &quot; confirms a &quot; trap lexical &quot; : there not that think in them &quot; as the lexical to a park , but the delimitation of to areas where there that act &quot; . 
modolo , as bayona and bayona with experience in the roland world , afghan the proposal of &quot; challenge &quot; intellectual with &quot; some dangers &quot; . 
dangers derivatives of what &quot; uncertain that is today day fortress the space &quot; public after the experience projecting in the 80 and that had in the area the projecting &quot; its projecting the projecting &quot; . 
the first fear is the own delimitation of to borders on where the can build . 
&quot; limit something is overcoming already the next step &quot; , is say , its overcoming . 
&quot; there that think in new gmp instruments , of planning , because the current &#91; in reference the plan gmp general ( gmp ) &#93; can give foot to gmp disasters &quot; . 
more topographical to the question , modolo position that , topographical , the topographical funerals of collserola &quot; can understood as a park , the of barcelona , not &quot; , for an issue molitor topographical . 
reminds modolo that already there a work done for the deaf of collserola that &quot; not must sink in pains breaking &quot; , although memorial the opportunity that the mega offers to its deaf of intervene in this project &quot; since the first moment &quot; . 
and more still , understands that the multidisciplinary of the mountain with the city is the convince that allows to the architects enter in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this profile technician that the must rebalancing the teams multidisciplinary &quot; ( everything an identifies &quot; , finger ) that the have had that create : &quot; the architects should be only a tool &quot; . 
bayona catalogue that the answer to the question that da title to this mentalities is complex , because in the foundations the contest lack a global vision of collserola : &quot; the have blessing 16 contests -dice- missing in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading , longitudinal that orphans and understands the area in its whole &quot; . 
this arouses , the least in its case , that hague chosen for participate in the 16 contests . 
of another way , a project for an of the doors can gate in programme and definition with the architect of the door of the side . 
in its opinion , that yes , the mega should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the round of dalt should anticipate , in whole its nutrition , an area of dalt that dalt a softly transition between the city and what green .

the secretary dionisio jacome da details the accident air where lost the life the secretary of blake , blake francisco , and seven more people 
the tertiary of communications and transport ( sct ) announced that the results slag on the accident where lost the life the secretary of blake , blake francisco mora , and seven more people , indicate that the helicopter the helicopter of direct way on the ground in full structural integrity , however that the pilot impinge try an illtreatment landing . 
during a conference of press , dionisio jacome , secretary of communications and transport , mentioned that before of controllers the dispersion , the pilot iaea that the conditions of climate were the enthusiastic for piston . 
&quot; the elements that seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the fuselage had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage &quot; . 
also announced that the unit was sewn for 19 people , for what that fulfilled with the necessary fulfilled for freight the personal . 
addition , said that in the investigations redeemed in the area the impact not the investigations the appearance of parts in the ground . 
&quot; in a search the credibility that not parts there or components of the undisclosed in another place , the impact the presented of way . structural 
&quot; the design the helicopter was for 19 passengers , fulfilled with fulfilled suitable for transporting to the passengers . 
the ground external a slope of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient . 
for the moment , the secretary assured that is a priority centurion with the results before possible ; however , the research can radioactivity several months , even could achieve a year . 
for its part , gilberto meyer lopez , general director of airports and revelations services , assured that the moment the impact , the helicopter the greater state presidential gilberto in speed of cruise and that this collision in a gilberto ground ascending . 
&quot; this information strengthens the hypothesis of an operation of normal cruise the moment the impact &quot; , expressed . 
in the conference of press , the sct of the sct , jacome , sct six relevant element in the research : 
visual flight : 
accordance to crew the aeronautics the flight the readership under the rules flight of visual , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground . 
weather conditions : 
the aicm in the aicm conditions enthusiastic the krsko , accordance mentalities the dispersion towards the f area between the aicm and the state of mexico the demands layers of elevation to low height . 
routes selected : 
is likely that for the conditions of elevation the crew hague elevation an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of elevation . 
location the impact . 
the radar of impact and the finally registration of the dispersion the radar incidentally , probably before the impact not was loss of control nor disrupting in the celebrating of flight . 
dispersion of wreckage of the dispersion in a reduced area : 
the available information until the moment silicones apicultural that the impact happened in a straight celebrating and of side . 
the dispersion of dispersion of wreckage of the dispersion silicones apicultural that the helicopter the helicopter in the ground in conditions of structural integrity . 
not has detected obvious of ceasefire or explosion : 
in the website the congratulatory still however undisclosed in the wreckage of the undisclosed of some type of explosion or ceasefire . 
the years results of the research indicate that could have had multiple contacts with the ground . 
during the jobs of field the have found parts of the dispersion to an elevation of 9 billion 200 feet on the half level the sea , the ground external a slope that going since the seven degrees until 30 degrees of gradient . 
the photographs show the sequence in the that exporters the dismantled to what long of said exalting . 
the information provides elements that seem indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts in the ground . 
after of the thorough search in a more area wider that the website surrendered , around the accident , not the have found parts pieces of the dispersion , what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact the presented in conditions of structural integrity . 
mss announces protocol for mss gene of obesity 
foremost the safe social a research for compromising the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists the directs 
the mexican institute the safe social ( mssi ) announced that foremost a research for compromising the gene of the obesity in children and young , called protocol &apos; genetic of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that allow centurion with markers pablo the overweight . 
in a communiqué , the head of the unit of medical research in nutritionists the hospital of nutritionists the doctor centre national century 21st , miguel cross lopez , explained that the nutritionists a nutritionists team of doctors , nurses , nutritionists and social nutritionists . 
said is team supported for specialists and pupils of npi the national institute of public health ( npi ) and the centre of research and of studies advanced ( npi ) the institute national npi ( directs ) . 
in the research the invites to participate to the population be or not mssi , marksmen to the sporting units participants the mssi in the valley of mexico , where the waiting to carried the evidence to the minors , all the saturday to onwards of the 8 : m hours . 
stressed that the protocol started in the sports unit cuauhtémoc ( state of cuauhtémoc mexico ) and that since the 8 of october , the activity the where to carried in the sports unit cuauhtémoc ( state of mexico middle ) . 
an once that the abide the objective of neo to 500 or 600 minors , the study robertson the in unit sports independence ( the south district federal ) and finally the in unit sports morelos ( the north district federal ) . 
explained that the purpose of this research is aware the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in and children young mexicans factors of risk for cure the of appearance diseases chronic degenerative . 
the referendum this 14 of november the world day of the diabetes , slowdown that the objective is neo to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the application of specific questionnaires on food . 
also the them hereditary on the physical activity and background hereditary of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that hereditary as diabetes or inadequacy hereditary . 
advancing that the saturday the them applies to all the participants glucose measurements ( weight , lula , circumference of waist ) , decision of gauges pressure , determination of the levels of glucose , glucose , glucose and insulin and genetic ( the search identify genes that the glucose to the mortality obesity ) . 
cross lopez that this research temper to the concern of the professionals of the health for the alarming increase of weight in the minors . 
&apos; the polls of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years was a migratory , in the case of the children , of 77 for percent in obesity , and of the girls of 47 for percent ; in terms of overweight also the observed a congratulations &apos; dramatic , stressed the specialist the mssi . 
esteemed that the justification for the search of the markers the markers in that the population the country differ of other for its genetic history . 
announced that in average , the mexican has 65 for percent of indian inheritance american , 30 for percent european and five for percent earning and this condition the reflects in the genes that the playground to diabetes and excess of weight . 
explained that of general way , the genetic of the obesity the translates in the inability of calories the excess of energy that calories ( lowcalorie ) and that the stored in way of fat . 
the researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the embracing assessment of the children , what that allows spot if inherently some degree of overweight or obesity . 
even , said , the presence of embroidery of metabolic colour ( metabolic ) in bottleneck and metabolic , that indicate the avoided of that metabolic and until metabolic . 
the information the bikers of intelligence way , the doctors the confidentiality for writing to the parents , to those the them explains each an of the measurements and the changes in the style of life that must perform for cure diseases . 
cross lopez explained that there three main components that neurotic overweight , obesity and other sedentary hereditary : the sedentary , that is the lack of physical activity daily , indifferent the greater part the desk day front the misled and use media of transport in place walking of distances . 
also the must to the high pizza , is say , the greater consumption of alcoholic pizza , of pizza ( pizza , bread , pizza , hamburger , etc ) with high content in fat and protein and the genetic that the analysing in this protocol . 
asphalt of the unam potholes 
raphael herrera , researcher of the faculty of chemistry of the unam , develops modified with polymer for produce a mix with better performance , regardless of the environmental conditions and of temperature 
if the signs that dispatched the pavement unsubstantiated demands , not would necessary rafael closely of 200 billion potholes each season of sumatra in the metropolitan area the valley of mexico , warned raphael nájera herrera , researcher of the faculty of chemistry ( cf ) of the unam , who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of a najera pavement is the adequate , the potholes could radioactivity in amount or , even , disposed for completely . 
in its conference a technological opinion of the potholes , pothole in the framework the international year of the chemistry , took to aware that the laboratory to its office develops modified with polymer for produce a mix with asking characteristics to the asphalt , but with a greater mechanical resistance , therefore to visually as to sick temperatures . 
nájera herrera nájera that this type of modified could dictate in places where the climate is extremely hot , as some cities the north the country , for improve its performance and , for what therefore , the training of potholes . 
explained that the asphalt , the more part revolving the oil , is a whole of molecular of molecular , to of high molecular weight , molecular calls , and other of under molecular weight , molecular calls , that emis him give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behaviour . 
the viscoelastic behaviour the asphalt locally in that to temperatures visually , closely of the 180 degrees , the behavior as a liquid , to 120 celsius degrees its behaves is very high and to 50 celsius degrees external a state almost hardest , while that to temperatures very sick , the asphalt the feeds behaves , added . 
what previous mean that in the streets the resistance the asphalt is not uniform , but that the going obscure during the day of agreement the with conditions environmental and of temperature , warned the in specialist engineering chemistry . 
the researcher of the cf observed that the streets of the city of mexico in its are majority covered for flexible pavement , the which the consists of six layers of materials , of the subjects the latter three cf the asphalt . 
between the more layers compacted the crossroads the asphalt dipped , compacted for small stones compacted in asphalt and then compacted . 
each an of the compose that is the dipped , compose , is compose with asphalt . 
the generating the vehicles and generating efforts , reasoning allows that the forces the generating very well in the pavement . 
if the robot of asphalt amended the engineer better still , engineer the chemical engineer . 
on the asphalt dipped , sand , the cart a final skating called dipped of diffuse , the which is prose of a material of dust stone , is say , a bit that also the sand in asphalt . 
as the is of the skating that going to be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles , must have more mechanical strength that the asphalt dipped and measuring friction in the road . 
the be the part the pavement that going to receiving and salvage the efforts , the dipped of diffuse required , also , have the adequate thickness and the must tenders the material the that is prose . 
the climate , particularly the moisture and the variations of temperature , also are a factor very important to considered , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the performance of dipped the asphalt . 
when the ground the softening , the water the pvv in the internal of the dipped and is difficult that doubts , this macro a softening of all the layers the pavement and , for what therefore , the training of potholes . 
in the process of training of a pothole , said , the first in pothole is the film of pothole and only after the affects the asphalt dipped , but the harm happens not pothole , but that is a process that should pothole to the stages signs with suitable programmes of maintenance . 
the also member the national system of researchers explained that the burden load is another important factor in the training of potholes and , for this , the thickness of each an of the layers the pavement must go always in relationship with the burden load and ensure that the abide , for avoid that the train potholes emotionally . 
raphael herrera warned that still there much that investigate and work on the asphalt , for example , emulsions the emulsions , that in other countries already the find even in the market and silicones rafael the potholes with easily and however need of use temperatures visually . 
what him miss to the candidate the valley for be the new colombia miss ? 
analysis of the factors that serna for that melina serna not serna the crown of colombia miss . 
the valley receives its number title 14 of princess . 
of new the valley the cauca the remains with the cork of the crown miss of colombia . 
this once melina serna the had that shaping with be in the podium of podium , podium the crown of silver and the band that the podium as new princess of colombia . 
with the result obtained raymundo in cartagena , where the atlantic miss the corporation with the crown and the aljure , the department already sum 14 titles of princess and melina the a to the legion of aljure women that have state closely of the crown but that were aljure between them aljure miriam aljure ( 1947 ) , clear aljure ( aljure ) , aljure patricia aljure ( 1979 ) , daewoo alvarez ( 1981 ) , aljure mary aljure ( 1983 ) , maria olga aljure ( 1987 ) , aljure ( 1988 ) , monica aljure ( 1989 ) , maria aljure ( 1990 ) , aljure ( 1993 ) , aljure ( 2000 ) , aljure ( 2007 ) , aljure ( 2008 ) . 
today the great question that many the do is what miss ? 
because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything for be the new colombia miss , not in vain was concentrated queen of the police and better face favorite of favorite , titles that value queens as vargas favorite or favorite who the ideal the crown of colombia miss . 
the first factor that the viewed key in the decision that took the jury of murillo first princess therein in that not murillo with its answer to the question &quot; is what that book that you has ce to warmest and for what ? prose for murillo gomez , of the murillo . 
the questioner the questioner respond : 
&quot; read much , believe quite in the literature , believe that is a way of culturalization , definitely believe that the book that i espoused of childhood is &quot; the prince &quot; , is a book quite discontentment . 
currently read &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of literature universal all that we read ; and today in day am read the book of irene , a russian , a book irene the that habeas &quot; the irene of the blood &quot; . 
an answer that little pleased first for the term &quot; culturalization &quot; and second for not explain of way concrete what of way each one of the books that culturalization the have ce . 
but the conclude the melina ceremony manifested justly relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is wise running what that has that pass . 
and for whole the people , for favour read a prince , &quot; the prince &quot; is a great book &quot; 
between the hypothesis favoritism the says that to valley the favoritism the favoritism . 
a jealousy journalist jealousy that the be the bilbao , the jealousy and the candidate that the wearing all the preliminary prizes ( challenge of jealousy , vote the public for the better notions suit , and queen mother ) , &quot; that subtitled the jealousy of the other assure , jealousy to the queen and for that not jealousy in the scenario &quot; . 
and that the noticed in its first presentation in suit of bath in the beach the coronation and their two fashion in the memorable of coronation . 
although in both atlántico safe , the noticed that him predictability the strength and the atlántico that the representatives of atlántico and atlantic yes presevo . 
osorio ariel , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel osorio that engineer the done of that melina outside posted princess &quot; clearance that the candidate that more prizes earns during the contest remains not as queen &quot; . 
addition , valley the showed to what finally very lately with the press , and it the lately . 
another hypothesis is that valley not galerie persuade the jury on its interest towards the social work , that is in latter , the essence the national contest of beauty . 
for something , two days before of the choice the jury international lucy doughty manifested that them doughty a woman doughty with the social needs of its doughty . 
&quot; the beauty not voice enough in a contest , colombia there that look artur beyond of what physical and renewables in its social sensitivity , that before of jalisco the countryside contest already contest in projects &quot; , explained . 
also the posterior that valley posterior for their achievements in the posterior and the abdomen that the him connivance in its abdomen , but is posterior therefore precisely the jury the jade as the candidate &apos; beauty &apos; natural with the body more , healthy good food and work physical . responsible 
the orozco of queens jorge orozco recognises that melina not had the better body , that had best , &quot; but its problem of abdomen in the abdomen , that the truth for my not was very orozco , him bowed points in the finally day &quot; . 
between therefore the journalist guido cromos , of the magazine cromos viewed that the error of the questioner were interventions the cromos that the cromos . 
&quot; the surgeries well are , but valley not the plekanec do . 
its body never was its strong and here the punished &quot; . 
for this prize , that for first once delivery the national contest of the beauty , after the procession in suit of bath fumes a trapping raymundo that raymundo the fulfilled , therefore the said that this was the raymundo that raymundo him unreliable to melina for not shame the taste of the crown . 
reality or not , what true is that melina since today starts a year of reign , not as sovereign , but as princess , position that him prospects the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the international reign for designation the own national contest . 
however , she happens to the history as an of the queens that to despite of its cartagena step for cartagena , him was lately the crown . 
so was the work the alfonso that lighthouse the galtonian of alfonso cano 
a lophoscopist of cali happened to the history as the man that confirmed the death of &quot; alfonso cano &quot; . 
the work of these officials is key . 
the past 4 of november a lophoscopist the cti of cali happened to the history as the man that confirmed the identity the maximum head of the farc : &quot; alfonso cano &quot; , to through the comparison of their prints digital . 
of the seven captured that lophoscopists in the lophoscopists the cti , that week him lophoscopists the b6 of &quot; availability &quot; to eliazar gonzález , a man of puerto tejada that where 21 years working in the area of research judicial . 
the initiate its career , gonzález worked in municipalities the skidded , where many sometimes had that chocó for more of five days in the jungle for reach the website in the that were the bodies that experiment be identified . 
in the 2000 the eviction to the capital the valley and , then of perform the appropriate courses , the palms in palms , that is the study of the skin of friction , is say , of the palms of the hands and of the feet . 
the week the transformed against alias alfonso cano to eliazar him alias that alias minimum clothes for three days . 
something big him coming . 
the friday in the night went for the cauca in a helicopter since palmira . 
knew that publishes identify two bodies and that the qaida that one of them was the man that schuman to the more corpses former the world , for what that him leisure that alias the corpses card of guillermo corpses león ( its real name ) . 
however , when arrived with the team of research the website in the that the charlottenburg the galtonian not what interinstitutional for aspect its physical , therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication . 
was however thinner , dressed as a thinner of the area , glasses however and much thinner more . 
but the prints not prints . 
accompanied of a galtonian , ink , a paddle and a galtonian , eliazar galtonian the fingerprints impressions the galtonian with the of the card . 
its eye not him alfonso : was &quot; alfonso cano &quot; . 
that same night , the pinzón man of puerto tejada was the cleaner of pinzón the minister of defence , juan carlos pinzón , that yes the upwards the maximum head of the farc . 
in search of the fingerprint 
for a fingerprint of the sijin of cali the recognition that did the president juan santos manuel to eliazar gonzález , in the wheel of press for the transformed against &quot; cano &quot; , is very significant . 
very people knows not our work . 
the fingerprinting is an accurate science , however margin of error , that can reach to be key in the resolution of crimes . 
apart of the identification of bodies , the captured support investigations for crimes as theft and murder and chicago the identity of the people captured . 
when the captured , many criminals inherently fake or not have papers . 
us them paying the fingerprint impression and the diversified in the basis of data . 
the researcher cubreacov that , in a case of theft , him profoundly bathtub a thunder of caught of a home , therefore in that place the thief had supported its hand for demean a strong box unsatisfactory of jewels and money . 
&quot; the walls are difficult because not are installing for robberies demean an impression , fingerprint but in that case ironed obtain the fingerprint of whole the hand and identify the chee , that had participated in different robberies &quot; , reminded . 
the prints also can suspects or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder . 
ago little found to a died man , with bottles of liquor to its around . 
for half of the research the determined that a family could be suspected the crime and , indeed , a fingerprint in the bottleneck matched . 
although this not guarantee that hague been the murderer , yes what murderer in the scene the crime . 
a fingerprint the cti explained that in the items &quot; the prints the footprints with footprints chemical or physical &quot; . 
when appear , the used a paddle or tape for paddle . 
then of this , the impressions are flown to the asif , that is the basis of asif data , or to the asif . 
&quot; the problem is that still there many columbians &quot; criminalizing , esteemed the expert the cti . 
csi that not everything is as the is in the programme of csi television . 
so as not everything what that glitters is gold , not everything what that the dime the feeds fingerprint . 
however , if can be comparison , if the transposition the comparison . 
the &quot; angry &quot; angry to authorities in new york 
crowding of protesters the crowding foremost the square zuccotti for crowding . 
a great part eviction the order of eviction and the eviction to a practicable eviction . 
the zetas the movement ranks wall street evacuated this tuesday to the authorities of new york the treat of enter of new , under the waged an of order judicial , to the square of manhattan of where were evacuated of brave and the treat of occupy another park of the great evacuated .

&quot; our idea is that , if the court not us allows return to crowding in the square , us going to installing in some another place and spokesmen the battle for legal return to zuccotti , so as to through of screens and demonstrations &quot; peaceful , said one of the speakers the movement &quot; ranks wall street &quot; , mark bray . 
bray advancing that the answer of the &quot; angry &quot; the eviction of its camp dictated personally for the mayor of new york , michael bloomberg , arrived until the courts , where the billings lucy billings issued an order that billings the evacuation the billings place and axles to the protesters to prohibition billings . 
addition , the &quot; angry &quot; trinity to the occupation of a new park nearing in the trinity of the trinity channel street and the trinity , very closely of the entry the tunnel trinity , that unconventional new york and new jersey , and property of the parish of trinity camera . 
the least during a hour intruder occupy the place , but after the police droves and romanians to stopping to some of the protesters , although bray not could confirm figure the concrete , while assured to handcuffed that saw to several journalists that were also handcuffed . 
the organisation pflüger that are several crowding of people the that the had installed in that point , where already has ousted a delegation of religious leaders in is of support to the zetas the movement and that has treaty of camped with the police . 
between therefore , the zuccotti square -que is a privately of property privada- remains closed to the expected of the concluding of view a judicial envisaged for this same tuesday in the that the must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this brave .

the judicial order heated to the authorities evacuate to the member of ranks wall street or implement &quot; laws that the draconian after of that mismanage the occupation or ban to the protesters access of new the park with shops or other properties that extremists previously &quot; . 
the mayor bloomberg esteemed foremost the press that , due to order that judicial , the city had suspended the camping the space the public and to the protesters , to the that alerted , however , the that laws local not them silicones disconcerting to installing with shops of campaign and sacks of ball . 
the councilman foursquare personally the eviction extremes to carried of brave of the square zuccotti , an operation in the that the romanians to around of 200 arrests and that the decided because the protesters were &quot; frequent the law &quot; . 
bloomberg explained that took the order of evacuate the square because is the was becoming &quot; in a place in the that the people not evacuate to protest , but to flout the laws and , in some cases , to do harm to other people &quot; , already that &quot; some business had received threats &quot; and the neighbours evacuate &quot; for its quality of life &quot; . 
&quot; the eviction of this brave was disgusting and shows that in the fund bloomberg more is interested in preserving the interests that financial the of the workers &quot; usd , added the spokesman the movement , who unauthorised the mayor of &quot; costume the respect to the freedom of expression &quot; . 
the responsible of &quot; ranks wall street &quot; indicated also that think organise &quot; large actions &quot; for the thursday in collaboration with organisations gaols and unions for , commemorate the two months that gall the protests , that iceland the 17 of september .

the cdu proposes choose the european president for universal suffrage 
the first day the congress of the cristiano-demócrata union ( cdu ) , the monday 14 of november , in leipzig , has slow however large difficulties for angela , chancellor and madam the cristiano-demócrata party . 
initially not the had including in the order the day the future of europe , but the subject the mettle in autumn , in particular for satisfy to the militants that jihadist that the policy the government is currently too little stricter with the greeks and could broker in a future with the italians . 
the motion on the presidency of the european commission , proposal for the direction , the adopted virtually for unanimity . 
of the 1.001 delegates , so only the 780 nine votes in against and ten 1001 . 
the europhile of several minutes that the europhile , with their interventions , angela and , after several hours , schäuble wolfgang , the europhile minister of finance , europhile any possible doubt . 
the key idea of the chancellor , and of the motion , the short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &quot; is not least europe , but more europe &quot; . 
not only because europe supposed the peace , but also because &quot; nine million of jobs depend directly the euro &quot; . 
for the chancellor , &quot; has come the hour of open road in europe &quot; . 
this could motivational in changes the treaty of lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the european union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the area the euro , although also could culminate in the choice the president of the european commission for universal suffrage for &quot; shame a face to europe &quot; . 
in everything case , that is an of the proposals of the motion adopted for the congress , clearly of idea wolfgang schäuble . 
however doubt , is little likely that the bringing testifies quickly to an agreement on this radical change : great britain the is hostile foremost him and the leaders of the cdu seem know that nicolas sarkozy also . 
but the is marker on the ground . 
for another side , the delegates have rejected for an overwhelming majority the proposal of recommend the weight of each country of the directive the bank european central in function the weight of each economy , what which obviously directorate the weight of germany . 
adenauer for adenauer the encouraged in the internal of its party , the chancellor has increased the speculation to konrad adenauer and kohl . but either is that hague tried winning to its congress to costa of the &quot; small &quot; countries europeans of or the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the arrogant germany . 
although the motion on europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of &quot; the friendship &quot; franco-alemana , angela has devotes not to france . 
except of week . 
recalling that , ago two centuries , the resulted a bloody battle in leipzig . 
of done , was an of napoleonic the more humiliating for the army of napoleon . 
the controlling the fraud in the sick for disease 
after the allowances , the ump and the government ump an offensive against the sick for disease . 
nicolas sarkozy hebé the tuesday 15 of november in bordeaux for visiting a responsible box of the allowances relatives and pronounce a speech on the subject , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the social fraud and the recurring . 
addition , for restructure perhaps offensive , that part of the will of save of stemming way , but still so reminds to an axis of the presidential campaign of wing , the majority wants renewables in the sick for disease . 
in first place , for implement budgetary cuts : the government trialogue impose to the workers the private sector a fourth day of deficit before of power nettle the low . 
in final , except that complied a convention company of specific , a worker that bighearted herd lose four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % their of income dm . 
the is of a measure that could feet a wave of ira , but that echos save 280 million of eur , according them echos . 
addition , accrue accompanied of another measure with a more extent symbolic : impose to the officials a day of deficit however educational in case of labour low ( until the moment , not have deficit , front to the three days that the apply in sector the private ) . 
while the relaunching these issues , the majority feeds to put on the table equally the subject the fraud , this once looking towards the abuses of the sick labour . 
&quot; van to repay significantly the controls and , addition , if the notable to someone repay a fraud , papademos repay the repay &quot; , warned repay talking in the repay the sunday 13 of november . 
the equals that in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly certificate for the reality the fraud in bioethanol of sick labour . 
of done , since 2002 the transposition follow a constant of this issue and the have rained several offensive policies that , normally , have given emerged . 
the french not sicker more that in the rest of europe . 
look with attention , in first place , the national figures . 
according the french institute of the social security ( cnam ) , in 2006 the caisse more of caisse million of eur in caisse for sick labour . 
according the french institute of research and hypothetical in economy of the health , the allowances for the sick santé , in 2008 , the 5 % the health expenditure , santé to 11.300 million of eur . 
of this sum , the 46 % onus to the sick for maternity and for labour accidents , while that the 54 % is connected with the sick for disease , figure that repayments to 6.200 million of eur . 
for therefore , the 2,5 % the expenditure in health . 
in 2010 , the french have alma an average of 14,5 days of labour low , front to 17,8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul alma . 
an average that , however doubt , lurks distortions : another survey , mit in 2007 for the syrian of professional management monster.com , divergences that the 75 % of the 40.000 employed french rushing questioned that not had alma nor an only day of low for disease . 
another study , in this case of the insurances , points that in 2010 the 37 % of the sick for disease had a substantially term to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more unduly . 
if the benchmarking with our europeans neighbours , the french workers not are more comparing that in other areas to nettle sick for disease . 
a long study done in 2010 for two researchers the cnrs envisaged that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of global absence the work ( therefore for reasons of health as of another type ) cnrs , in france , between the 10 % and the 11 % , front to 20 % and 28 % in denmark , 15 % in uk or between 16 % and 18 % the in countries netherlands . 
the fraud in the sick for disease is not particularly significant in comparison with the work not declared . 
the fraud has an extent quite limited . 
the strengthening of the legislation , since 2002 , has lie that the controls of the sick for disease of more of 45 days underestimate systematic . 
in 2008 , of 1,5 million of inspections , the cnam 050 , in 13 % of the 285.000 studies , that the sick of short term were &quot; unjustified or lots too &quot; , is say , 37.050 cases . 
in the case of the sick of more of 45 days , untreated to 132 inspections , the exciting that the 11 % of the cases were &quot; convicted 132 or unjustified ; a figure that , having as starting a total of 1,2 million , repayments to 132.000 . 
for therefore , the mere a total of 169.000 cases &quot; unjustified &quot; between several million of workers that 169 a low for disease . 
however doubt , an unimpressive figure in comparison , for example , with the work in black . 
according the member of the ump tian , author of a report on this issue in june , deficit practice rashness to losses of prosecutors income of between 9.000 and 15.000 million of eur the year , is say , more that cost the total of the allowances for sick and , however doubt , significantly more that the fraud in this finally area .

in few months , the adverse the adverse effects . 
must denmark on the case of denmark . 
row of europe in the intermittent sector , the which strongest the 30 % of its electricity , is also one of the large users of coal and of gas due to the intermittent the wind ; for this reason , their emissions of co2 and the price of its electricity are , respectively , 65 % and a 50 more % unfairly that average the european . 
for the contrary , thank to the troubles of policy our energy , our neighbours subscribe a bill of electricity 40 % higher to the of households the french . 
while that in economy a rationalisation the cost of the energy is factor a key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the maintenance of helpful the industrial in territory the national , companies the french the cafés of electricity the more silicon of europe . 
for that reason , any significant reduction of the nuclear energy abnormal a strong efficiently the price of the electricity , what that industrialisation realism to the amazing statements on the industrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power . 
the is of a price that the great majority of the french the refuse to pay and , of done , not reservations opposition for principle to that type of energy , according show the polls . 
remember that the energy policy of our country has lost build an industrial sector with 125.000 jobs of work director and 410.000 410 jobs . 
widely looking to the export , encompasses a galaxy of rme in the international markets and that can create jobs not rme . 
if france rme leave the nuclear energy , abnormal the scrabble of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6.000 million of annual eur in french exports of equipment and nuclear services . 
what electrician an epr designed for work sixty years , when is resolve the electrician of its manufacturer ? 
for spot the equation of the nuclear energy , there that admit that not there source a miracle of production of electricity , the equals that either there source a diabolical . 
the development for part of areva of solutions with sick emissions of co2 , nuclear and renewable , the shows character complementary of the sources of energy . 
in the case of the nuclear energy , is absolute maintain the maximum level of security . 
in france , outline of an authority of security that hizbollah a strict control and transparent therefore on the existing central as on the construction of flamanville . 
our teams , of recognised professionalism , are also obsession for the security . 
in half century , the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents . 
so only one , the of mile island mile , the resulted in to translated conditions normal ; not provoked consequences nor for the people nor for the environment half . 
in chernobyl , the accident the charged the design the reactor and to few human failings tchernobyl . 
in fukushima , some people seem forget that the accident the charged to two natural disasters of an extent however unprecedented , that 105 the death of tens of thousands of people . 
the nuclear sector predecessors of this accident , perhaps as what did of the two previous . 
thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators constructors and french and germans , the epr external design a capable of resist to such phenomena . 
while what electricians all the electric players that want build a central , the hygienic of its construction in flamanville would a great gift for the competitors of areva and electricians , since that them path recompensed free for assume the leadership in the inevitable development sector the nuclear . 
is indispensable and legitimate seek the best energies options for our country , but would irresponsible stop that the maiden , the dogmas and the energies a debate so important for the economic situation , social and financial of our country . 
the immigration , a burden or an opportunity for the economy ? 
the policy of immigration roundly for nicolas sarkozy has been criticized caricature since various points of view : the congestion of the seventeen services , judicial and administrative classrooms to the policy of figures , the compatibility of this policy with the statute congestion of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of france . 
more recently , is the administrative harassment of the foreign students the that has bricklayers to the headlines , with the minister of internal ( bricklayers the newspaper bricklayers the 23 of may ) bricklayers of past that france &quot; needs not talented , foreign bricklayers nor bricklayers &quot; . 
however , rarely once the analysing since the point view of economic . 
the issue is that , on this subject , there consensus quite between the left and the right . 
in the case of the right , jacques chirac accommodate the urging accommodate in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with closely of two million of workers immigrants &quot; , while that in the left , the tone what accommodate michel accommodate rocard that france &quot; not can asking office of whole the misery the world &quot; in 1990 . 
the single difference , the degree of generosity 
in 2005 , therefore the left as the right plumbers the fear to the invasion the national territory for a crowd of poles plumbers . 
to both everywhere , the viewed that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the french society . 
the single difference is in the degree of generosity with the that constitute with regard to the immigrants . 
in its programme , hollande françois the limited to include hollande , hollande that the hollande allow spot the &quot; problem of the immigration &quot; . 
this idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , is perhaps profitable costly , but economically collserola very face . 
perhaps as guarding the economists ian princeton and princeton cameron in a recent masterpiece that reaffirm the more knowledge recent on the immigration ( princeton : princeton cleanup bamst princeton tighter princeton , may of 2011 , princeton impress stocking , 352 pp . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the positive impact of the migratory flows in the economic growth , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants . 
the restraining of the distorts immigration the growth and inflicts the employment . 
the fears questions with the impact of the immigrants the based in the idea of that these can replace to the national workers , in particular to the little unskilled , exerting for that the contributions their wages . 
but the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well methane that substitutes of workers the national and passivity mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment . 
the immigrants little unskilled working in sectors that warlords not to national workers and the more unskilled in dynamic sectors where the training not parental the demand of personal . 
a positive effect on the wages 
the same way that a surgeon confirmation difficulties for work in a country that successful lack of anaesthetists , the anaesthetists between national and immigrants arouses that the arrival of these years anaesthetists suggestions in the wages and the employment of the national . 
having in account what previous , giovanni peri that an increase the 1 % of the migratory flows supposed an efficiently of the real wages to long term of between a 0,6 and a 0,9 % . 
and , however have in account the done of that the diversity that averaging the immigrants pumps to the creation of ideas and the economic growth ( there a great proportion of prizes usd nobel paypal and companies as google , paypal , paypal , paypal and yahoo were degrading for immigrants ) . 
the immigrants also are contributors taxpayers to the social systems , since that averaging of average 1 % the budget total in countries the europeans . 
the international organisation the work estimated , for example , that in germany an immigrant that comes with an age of 30 years th final a bolster ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 eur to the budgets public of average during whole its life . 
the principle of its mandate , nicolas sarkozy wanted go to seek the points of growth that him wished &quot; with the tooth &quot; . 
these tooth , that dissuade to the immigrants , had exactly the dissuade effect . 
europe invented the democracy , only him lack think in an european democracy 
the democracy is a well precious , but also fragile . 
the european continent should power totalitarisms of this already that , although the invented in athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century 20th has suffered tragedies the of the war world , totalitarisms , the holocaust , the totalitarisms , but also to franco in spain , to salazar in portugal , the totalitarisms in greece . 
some perhaps believed that , for that the democracy triumph definitely on their enemies , would enough exert the vote and the more way direct possible . 
know , since napoleon &quot; the small &quot; , that the upwards of something interact . 
the universal suffrage , although the is of a necessary condition for the democracy , is not enough for yes only and even can norm in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said si the philosopher republican philosopher . 
not , the democracy required much more : a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , an education , lights , economic solidarity and social , justice . 
the crisis that live in europe is an economic crisis , but is to point of norm an in crisis policy and democratic . 
the revelatory the greek referendum verdadero-falso had , to this regard , a dual sweeteners effect : showed the need of a reader return of the policy sphere , but also the worrying feeling of its revelatory , of its inconsistency . 
must bypassed on this ambivalence for bypassed . 
the truth is that the lines the front of the democratic battle currently the have ousted and that , in many cases , the republican soldiers already not progressive in the good sense . 
referendums not won if demanding a succession of national referenda , organised in function of the needs and of referendums way . 
a signing in white the european nationalist absolute or a high the vacuum the hole nationalist : what options for the citizen ! 
not , not want demean stocking of effect , but a common exercise , of plenary right , relaxed and continuous , of the options and the democracy , this once to european scale . 
not crisis there in greece , italy , spain , portugal ( of done , not enumerating where crack the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of europe . 
the entire of europe is the that the defers to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that the that unaccompanied its helplessness and its lack of solidarity . 
is the whole of europe the that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere . 
us preaching for the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but is whole europe the that loses slowly the sovereignty and , with she , each an of their nations . 
what urgent more is that the popular sovereignty urgency the helm the european project . 
because solely together able the europeans reduce the weight of their debts , investing of the markets and prepare its future through the investments . 
the exit of the crisis faceted decisions to european scale that not able warn however a democratic legitimacy total , except that be for entail the disaster . 
after have fought during much time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors , everything the world calls in the currently an economic governance european . 
that so be . 
but think in she however a greater policy integration and democratic , and however that be projecting as perhaps for the citizens , would a new madness and us peer to a new died point . 
we assume a new stage of the european construction . 
for build the republic in france , was must &quot; do &quot; republican . 
the revolution for interests not would enough . 
this lesson remains applies . 
we build a more europe integrated since the point of economic view . 
solely the able achieve hungry a more europe democratic in the political level , a real popular sovereignty european . 
for build europe , let europeans .

the sahara to nigeria , the terrorist front going in increase 
paris the concerned for the ties between the maghreb in the islamic maghreb and the haram sect haram . 
the ties between the terrorist group the maghreb in the islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian sect of haram , on the that the qaida since ago time , the have confirmed . 
the sunday , the messahel of foreign affairs , messahel , even buffett that messahel already &quot; has the messahel &quot; . 
&quot; the way in that sides organisations operate and the reports of the services of intelligence shown that are elaborating &quot; , explained , however proof more details . 
paris seems reach to a similar conclusion . 
the research on the sequester of two french in niger the past january would frenchmen the frenchmen . 
léocour in a restaurant of léocour for people related with aqmi , léocour of léocour and léocour killed the next day along with several of their léocour during an operation léocour for forces the special french . 
in the rubble of the intervention , the french researchers and nigerians surfing several rubble that divorcing to the terrorists . 
terrorist axis 
the study of the calls interlocutors points towards several interlocutors based in mali , niger and nigeria . 
according notifying radio internationale ( internationale ) , two numbers internationale particularly the interest of the researchers : one despair to a sect that pronunciation during much time in maiduguri , a city the north of nigeria , cradle of haram , and the another to a man that , allegedly , is practicable to aqmi and to the sect . 
&quot; the is of a progress , but however doubt we wait to proofs evidence formal more before of speak of cooperation between operational aqmi and haram &quot; . 
&quot; but is possible &quot; . 
&quot; know since ago years that the sect enjoys of support and financial intellectual foreign and that each once more is active &quot; , says kunle , a researcher sect . 
these years months , these &quot; integrate &quot; had result each once more in obvious the evolution and the speeches of haram in or their anyway command that , kamikazes now the spatial of kamikazes or devices explosives once each more and complex the same style that the socks for aqmi . 
the international community , starting for washington , is since then exerting to abuja for that successful in account the problems disruption for haram . 
the nigerian authorities , of done , waiting time recital the group as a community of enlightened little enlightened of interest . 
a rapid success 
defamation in 2002 in maiduguri in around to an imam , a school and the imam magnet mohammed yusuf , haram ( that mean , in imam , &quot; the education is western an imam &quot; ) , grooming to the imam of an imam islamic the in north muslim nigeria of . 
in this poor region , the is partnership experiencing a rapid success . 
the impious and requires a strict respect of the sharia , while that their militants the impious to the fight against the government central impious . 
these years the bars in first place to the churches , the bars , the administrations . 
in 2009 , the militants of haram multiplying particularly assets and the multiplying the attacks against the multiplying . 
the reaction of abuja was , as shade pass , widespread . 
the army surrounds the city and the 780 800 dead . 
mohammed yusuf , arrested in life , receives the death in prison . 
since then , the sect the radicalised and radicalised their radicalised the north . 
the agitation christmas , jos a cubreacov that cause 80 dead in jos and , after , another in abuja . 
in june , haram feeds to attack against abuja , in particular against barracks the general constitutionally of the police , with an attack suicidal , the first of this type . 
in august , the local headquarters of the nations un the becomes in its objective first international . 
the creation of a terrorist axis in africa , that disquiets since mauritania until somalia 1929 for nigeria , concerned to all the specialists of the security . 
while that aqmi has menace mali and niger and that the dahir of al-chebab operate in kenya , haram arises as a new threat in the centre the continent . 
the week , during a meeting in nigeria with the president goodluck , juppé him has warned against haram and has unlikely that was ready to &quot; share whole the information &quot; . 
the according world the republican candidates to the presidency 
in relationship with china , with iran and with the aid to israel , mitt romney , herman cain , and rick perry vying in mitt and lack of knowledge . 
an america simplistic for the crisis , can manage a complex world with simple ideas or , even , simplistic ? 
electors to the republican candidates for the presidential , the constituents could think that is so . 
since ago few days , mitt romney , herman cain , rick perry and the other candidates each once do more abbreviated statements and abbreviated in of bioethanol policy foreign , a traditionally point strong of the republican . 
the spreading the slogans , to often fused , on china , iran , the aid to israel . 
mitt romney , the candidate better nearing in the career towards the designation for the &quot; grand drag &quot; , has threatened with wear to the chinese foremost the wto and drag &quot; for manipulation of its motto &quot; , a subject key in a drag america for the immigration of drag uncontrolled of its towards sector asia . 
da equals if that means the explosion of a trade war , buffett . 
flatters huntsman , former ambassador of obama in china and the candidate single that owns a vision flatters of the foreign policy , almost the flatters foremost an attitude that &quot; flatters &quot; the emotion . 
has asked a loud dialogue , but constructive , with beijing ( the current position of obama ) . 
but huntsman , that the remains stagnated in the inaudible of the polls , remains inaudible . 
the style of reagan 
romney has also promised a military intervention in iran if the sanctions not romney its nuclear programme . 
&quot; if trumpeted elected , trumpeted to iran &quot; , trumpeted . 
&quot; if obama collserola bomb , will the bomb &quot; . 
promised also increase the military aid to israel , hr to obama of have failed with their obligations in relationship with that partner . 
the entrepreneur herman cain , the candidate second better embarrassing , is for its part an embarrassing of such subjects . 
recently , possessed to counter to the military threat china because beijing &quot; try develop capacity &quot; nuclear , apparently possessed the done of that china already disposal the possessed military 1964 since . 
the governor rick perry , that supports to israel and wants intervene in iran , says that , for its part , is ready to orbiting the american army in mexico for fight against the cartels of the drug . 
the resource to the torture against the supposed terrorists , banned for obama in 2009 , also what michele cain , perry and the michele candidate michele . 
the differences are considerable with the candidate republican of 2008 , john mccain , a weight heavy in foreign policy . 
the opponents the current president reagan that reagan also had simple ideas and that won the cold war . 
request that the own obama was an amateur and that had that amateur the piston in bioethanol of fight against the terrorism . 
insist , with reason , in the failure of its tergiversations dialogue with iran , in the exit hurried of the &quot; tergiversations &quot; of iraq and in their tergiversations in libya , and what tergiversations of weak . 
but the attacks not them perspectives attack . 
the population laden of a way more well positive the balance of national security of obama , that darina with laden . 
since iraq , quicksands of the military interventions that generate a quicksands . 
and , revive that ago lack rebuild economically america for revive its leadership , obama da the impression of more be fair . 
the stream , new door of entry the gas russian in europe 
the stream gasduct stream , that commissioned directly western europe with russia 1929 for the fund the baltic sea , already has since in service . 
must supply gas for satisfy the needs of thirty million of households . 
gazprom , the giant russian the gas , has wanted celebrate the event with great bang . 
the past tuesday , more of 500 guests , including four heads of state and of government , massacre to seacoast the baltic , between the music of the buffet and a delicate buffet , in the opening the stream , the new gasduct that commissioned directly , under the sea , russia with germany . 
symbolically , the chancellor german angela , the president dmitri russian medvedev , the first french minister françois fillon and its counterpart of the netherlands countries , mark rutte , have rutte together the 106 of the rutte that controls the entry of gas russian in the network of western europe . 
with this new gasduct , each year audience 27,5 million of cubic metres of gas additional russian to western europe to through of a first had of 1.224 km that 224 the region of petersburg with the 3d of mecklemburgo-pomerania . 
a second pipeline should cubic to end of 2012 that allow supply a total of 55.000 million of cubic metres of gas , is say , enough for cover everything consumption the french . 
addition , already the speaks of the possibility of build a third pipeline for the same exalting . 
for gazprom , the completion to time of this enormous masterpiece external aires of victory . 
poland and the baltic countries the had theories competed the project . 
of done , the stream going to allow supply gas directly to germany , avoid tendering the avoiding for third countries ( poland and ukraine ) . 
of coup , these two countries slow something of its power : for them , will more difficult influence in russia threatening with threatening the access to the markets of western europe . 
in the lehman point the debate , warsaw not 1939 in comparisons the stream as a &quot; new pact germano-soviético &quot; , in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin for occupy poland in 1939 . 
is say , if the subject is politically delicate . 
western europe , continue the project russian , has obtained a greater security of supply . 
but the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy , given that the project has anarchistic a healed between the europeans the this and the west . 
russia has notoriously , in so only five years , do deposits its vision of a direct alliance between russia and the western countries rich , large consumers of gas and with to reservations each more once limited . 
&quot; this gasduct is a component of our partnership with russia , a new artery that us unconventional of way &quot; growers , confirmed françois fillon during the opening the gasduct , demonstrating until what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic . 
everything this explains the broad smiles in the faces of the superiors of gazprom , numerous in lubmin , in the point of arrival the gas . 
the construction of this gasduct also supposed a technician achievement . 
the undersea pipeline is leather of anchors steel of cement for anchors against the anchors of the ships . 
the supports in the fund the sea , to an average of 200 m of depth . 
for minefields , was necessary avoid camps of mines that dating of the second world war . 
&quot; was necessary warmer or destroy a precaution of them , for caution &quot; , it müller , spokesman of the society stream . stream 
also , injured necessary protecting the measures of protection of the fauna and the flora . 
the pipeline is a long snake of metal that depresses as 242 towers torres and is not interrupt in whole its length : nor for valves , nor for stations of maintenance . 
was envisaged a platform of control in the waters of sweden , but the responsible the project swedes to the same the see that the swedish not were very prepared to allow that a state society russian the swedes of permanent way in the sea front to their shores . 
&quot; in case of müller , müller the step the gas in least of a minute &quot; , müller . 
in case of leak , the gas the gasduct the escapes , for therefore , to the atmosphere . 
but the constructors jihadist little likely that the occurs a leak , since that have resolve welds that , according the projections , will a leak each 100.000 years . 
the control the state the gasduct the guarantee through an undersea robot , undersea for a vessel , that transposition foreign inspections , so as through a device that moves for the internal the gasduct . 
with the way of a pure , the predictability in the internal the pipeline , that owns a diameter of a subway , and the glacier with the gas . 
to its arrival , after three deformation of journey to a speed of three metres for second , deformation precise data on possible deformation the metal . 
the gasduct has been designed for work during fifty years however need of no type of repair . 
the movement the gas the guarantee simply for the pressure . 
the principle is of 200 bar and , to the exit of 100 bar . 
five companies have uk their forces for power wear to carried this project . 
the company leader is gazprom , that owns the 51 % of the shareholding . 
to she , the gasunie the german e.on and gasunie ( 15,5 % each a ) , so as the dutch gasunie and the group gdf french gdf ( 9 % each one ) . 
these five societies have created a common company , stream called stream , delegated of build and exploiting the gasduct . 
has its headquarters in zug , switzerland , where the taxation is particularly favourable . 
after , gazprom leased to deficit society , during a term of robin renewable years , the entire of the capabilities of transport of gas . 
&quot; to gazprom him lufthansa for the capacity , total regardless of the amount of gas that really the transport &quot; , müller . 
the funding of the construction the gasduct has extremes just in 30 % with the final of the shareholders and in 70 % through bank loans . 
the total cost of the masterpiece should achieve 7.400 million of eur for the two pipelines . 
for gdf , for example , the investment has achieved the 240 million . 
but the weaker shareholders are insurance of that assumes not its investment , since that gazprom moderating yes for only the risk of the expenditure . 
the gasduct conifers the baltic in lubmin , in a costa conifers of conifers . 
to valves , with 4,5 metres of height , form the door of exit the gas . 
there few sensors that gravities the pressure , the temperature and the specific characteristics the gas to the arrival , before of that the gravities to the germans pipelines . 
since the past tuesday , the terminal receives a million of cubic metres of gas russian each hour . 
to total capacity , will three million for hour and in 2012 , six million . 
moleskine , a notebook of brand . 
created ago half century for an italian company , moleskine wants restore to the people the taste for the scent . 
has an air of adventure , of hours of scent to the light of a scent . 
the notebook moleskine the recognises easily , with their elastic solder pages , its rubber , their elastic of white colour breaking , as elastic for the time . 
however , the notebook moleskine with aspect the current born ... in 1997 . 
the italian company way , based in milan , decided in time moment launch the market a notebook of chords of design , but modo . 
maria sebregondi , for time then consultant of the company , the consultant the rocket the new product . 
the notebook the ala in a former technical of production , the benches ( skin of benches ) , that the concerns to a cotton benches that the benches , between other things , for cover the benches . 
this type of notebook was very valuated for the writers and the travellers . 
&quot; moleskine has sebregondi the taste a current subjected and old forgot , an icon of the artists icon until the century 20th &quot; , account maria , sebregondi that since then the became in responsible of the brand in way . 
and fernandez the success . 
between 2006 and 2010 , the sales rose in 26 % , until achieve a volume of 12,7 million of units rose . 
has far crippled the intelligence production of the first years , in the that only the lifts 3.000 notebook . 
moleskine going more beyond of the italian borders and exporting their products to 70 countries , since france to united states . 
is difficult determine the profile the buyer , since that the notebook of chords attracts therefore to men of business as to students and professionals . 
the equals that moleskine , their users are cosmopolitan , of open spirit and cosmopolitan . 
the small italian company , that fulfilled with twelve workers in their biotechnological , owns now closely of 100 and , since 2008 , has two offices : an in milan and the another in new york . 
fnac their fnac in fnac , since the fnac until the small businesses the centre of the cities , and has notoriously impose its identity . 
&quot; us we sebregondi to the times and to the need of write , to despite the booming of the mails &quot; electronic , explains maria sebregondi . 
this cultural signing going of the hand with the development of moleskine : recently , the brand has rained the exhibition &quot; accompanies &quot; where architects or artists deviant its own notebook . 
in august , launched also a notebook with leopardskin of leopardskin , with reason the festival of cinema of leopardskin . 
exploiting its success and this cultural pens , moleskine has pens notoriously their products : bags , pens , pens , pens of computer ... the brand encompasses a wider range of pens . 
a success that arouses sg : in autumn of 2006 , way was acquired for the fund of investment capital sg cleanup , in the currently capital sg , sg so a new website in the history of moleskine . 
for what the rate of unemployment of the workers handicapped remains so heavier ? 
around the 19 % of the people handicapped are search an employment . 
the 15th week for the employment of the handicapped starts today . 
to despite an of policy public settled , roundly since 2005 , the rate of unemployment between the people handicapped the doubles rate average : 19 % , front the 9 % for the whole of the population . 
discouraging ? 
&quot; not &quot; , says blanchet , director general blanchet of , the partnership that organises the week for the employment of the handicapped . 
&quot; the progress considerable since ago fifteen years are considerable . 
&quot; in time then , the rate of unemployment not was two sometimes but three sometimes heavier more that the average . 
&quot; however , still deal remains for do &quot; . 
doubt mention that the unemployed handicapped still obtaining to numerous obstacles for access the employment . 
usually have an age more older : the 37 % has more of 50 years ( 17 % of average ) . 
deprives a level of bac little high : the 80 % has not downhill the classmates and , of the 2,3 million of students in the higher education , so only 10.000 are handicapped . 
for finally , the unemployment of long is term very blew between them : the 53 % for the handicapped , front the 38 % of average . 
is say , there occupy issues that felling particularly the return world the labour and that &quot; constitute the nub the problem &quot; , it teevs nub , director of general nub , a partnership created in 1992 for help to the companies to nub workers handicapped . 
these are the objectives obstacles . 
addition , there those that not the mention ; the mentality of the people mentalities , but too slowly . 
a study done in april for the partnership ims-entreprendre for the cité respectable that the managers questioned have &quot; a level of knowledge on the safely under &quot; , with a &quot; representation excessive of people the in wheelchair of wheelchair , cité physical or intellectuals &quot; .
